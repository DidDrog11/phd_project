  1. Think about what you want to say and try to write it as concisely and simply as possible
  2. Flow of paragraphs to include linking and reinforcing the message
  3. No comma after include or such as
  4. Lists in a sentance use - rather than including, 
  5. Keep terminology consistent
  6. Signposting either at the beginning of a paragraph and linking to the above or at the end of a paragraph.
  7. New paragraphs when the topic changes
