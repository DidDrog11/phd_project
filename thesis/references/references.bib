	abstract = {Land use change-for example, the conversion of natural habitats to agricultural or urban ecosystems-is widely recognized to influence the risk and emergence of zoonotic disease in humans1,2. However, whether such changes in risk are underpinned by predictable ecological changes remains unclear. It has been suggested that habitat disturbance might cause predictable changes in the local diversity and taxonomic composition of potential reservoir hosts, owing to systematic, trait-mediated differences in species resilience to human pressures3,4. Here we analyse 6,801 ecological assemblages and 376 host species worldwide, controlling for research effort, and show that land use has global and systematic effects on local zoonotic host communities. Known wildlife hosts of human-shared pathogens and parasites overall comprise a greater proportion of local species richness (18-72\% higher) and total abundance (21-144\% higher) in sites under substantial human use (secondary, agricultural and urban ecosystems) compared with nearby undisturbed habitats. The magnitude of this effect varies taxonomically and is strongest for rodent, bat and passerine bird zoonotic host species, which may be one factor that underpins the global importance of these taxa as zoonotic reservoirs. We further show that mammal species that harbour more pathogens overall (either human-shared or non-human-shared) are more likely to occur in human-managed ecosystems, suggesting that these trends may be mediated by ecological or life-history traits that influence both host status and tolerance to human disturbance5,6. Our results suggest that global changes in the mode and the intensity of land use are creating expanding hazardous interfaces between people, livestock and wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic disease.},

Our models predict reservoir status in this group with over 90\% accuracy, identifying species with high probabilities of harboring undiscovered zoonotic pathogens based on trait profiles that may serve as rules of thumb to distinguish reservoirs from nonreservoir species. Key predictors of zoonotic reservoirs include biogeographical properties, such as range size, as well as intrinsic host traits associated with lifetime reproductive output.

Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences of nucleoprotein ({NP}), glycoprotein precursor ({GPC}), and polymerase (L) genes showed 5 separate clades within lineage {IV} of {LASV} in this country. The sequence diversity was higher than previously observed; mean diversity was 7.01\% for nucleoprotein gene at the nucleotide level.

	abstract = {In agriculture, both valuable ecosystem services and unwanted ecosystem disservices can be produced by the same organism group. For example, small rodents can provide biological control through weed seed consumption but may also act as pests, causing crop damage. We studied the hypothesized causal relationships between ecosystem services (removal of weed seeds) and disservices (removal of wheat grains and crop damage) derived by small rodents (voles and mice) at multiple spatial scales. At the landscape scale, we studied the effects of landscape compositional and configurational heterogeneity on the abundance of voles and mice and their related ecosystem services and disservices along the former inner German border in east and west Germany. At the local scale, we studied how abundance and ecosystem functions are affected by management intensity (organic vs. conventional winter wheat), associated differences in crop characteristics and edge effects. Linear mixed-effects models and path analysis show that voles drove ecosystem disservices, but not ecosystem services, in agricultural fields. Daily wheat seed removal by voles was influenced by increasing wheat height and was almost three times higher than weed seed removal, which was not related to local- or landscape-scale effects. Abundance of voles and associated crop damage decreased with lower crop density and higher wheat height, which were associated with organic farming. Abundance of voles and crop damage were highest in conventional fields in west Germany. Synthesis and applications. As the ecosystem disservice of wheat seed consumption by small rodents must be considered mainly during crop sowing, management before crop harvest should focus on decreasing the pest potential of voles but not mice. Our results suggest that densities of voles and their ecosystem disservices could be reduced by having fields with low crop density and high wheat height, practices associated with organic farming. Surrounding landscapes with low compositional and configurational heterogeneity could further reduce voles’ pest potential, but with probable negative effects on farmland biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Utilitarian arguments concerning the value of biodiversity often include the benefits of animals, plants, and microbes as sources of medicines and as laboratory models of disease. The concept that species diversity per se may influence risk of exposure to disease has not been well developed, however. We present a conceptual model of how high species richness and evenness in communities of terrestrial vertebrates may reduce risk of exposure to Lyme disease, a spirochetal ( Borrelia burgdorferi) disease transmitted by ixodid tick vectors. Many ticks never become infected because some hosts are highly inefficient at transmitting spirochete infections to feeding ticks. In North America, the most competent reservoir host for the Lyme disease agent is the white-footed mouse ( Peromyscus leucopus), a species that is widespread and locally abundant. We suggest that increases in species diversity within host communities may dilute the power of white-footed mice to infect ticks by causing more ticks to feed on inefficient disease reservoirs. High species diversity therefore is expected to result in lower prevalence of infection in ticks and consequently in lower risk of human exposure to Lyme disease. Analyses of states and multistate regions along the east coast of the United States demonstrated significant negative correlations between species richness of terrestrial small mammals (orders Rodentia, Insectivora, and Lagomorpha), a key group of hosts for ticks, and per capita numbers of reported Lyme disease cases, which supports our “dilution effect” hypothesis. We contrasted these findings to what might be expected when vectors acquire disease agents efficiently from many hosts, in which case infection prevalence of ticks may increase with increasing diversity hosts. A positive correlation between per capita Lyme disease cases and species richness of ground-dwelling birds supported this hypothesis, which we call the “rescue effect.” The reservoir competence of hosts within vertebrate communities and the degree of specialization by ticks on particular hosts will strongly influence the relationship between species diversity and the risk of exposure to the many vector-borne diseases that plague humans.},

The study found several examples in which agricultural intensification and/or environmental change were associated with an increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence, driven by the impact of an expanding human population and changing human behavior on the environment. We conclude that the rate of future zoonotic disease emergence or reemergence will be closely linked to the evolution of the agriculture–environment nexus. However, available research inadequately addresses the complexity and interrelatedness of environmental, biological, economic, and social dimensions of zoonotic pathogen emergence, which significantly limits our ability to predict, prevent, and respond to zoonotic disease emergence.},

	abstract = {Infectious diseases of humans, wildlife, and domesticated species are increasing worldwide, driving the need to understand the mechanisms that shape outbreaks. Simultaneously, human activities are drastically reducing biodiversity. These concurrent patterns have prompted repeated suggestions that biodiversity and disease are linked. For example, the dilution effect hypothesis posits that these patterns are causally related; diverse host communities inhibit the spread of parasites via several mechanisms, such as by regulating populations of susceptible hosts or interfering with parasite transmission. However, the generality of the dilution effect hypothesis remains controversial, especially for zoonotic diseases of humans. Here we provide broad evidence that host diversity inhibits parasite abundance using a meta-analysis of 202 effect sizes on 61 parasite species. The magnitude of these effects was independent of host density, study design, and type and specialization of parasites, indicating that dilution was robust across all ecological contexts examined. However, the magnitude of dilution was more closely related to the frequency, rather than density, of focal host species. Importantly, observational studies overwhelmingly documented dilution effects, and there was also significant evidence for dilution effects of zoonotic parasites of humans. Thus, dilution effects occur commonly in nature, and they may modulate human disease risk. A second analysis identified similar effects of diversity in plant–herbivore systems. Thus, although there can be exceptions, our results indicate that biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and herbivory. Consequently, anthropogenic declines in biodiversity could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and forest production.},

	abstract = {Host-virus association data underpin research into the distribution and eco-evolutionary correlates of viral diversity and zoonotic risk across host species. However, current knowledge of the wildlife virome is inherently constrained by historical discovery effort, and there are concerns that the reliability of ecological inference from host-virus data may be undermined by taxonomic and geographical sampling biases. Here, we evaluate whether current estimates of host-level viral diversity in wild mammals are stable enough to be considered biologically meaningful, by analysing a comprehensive dataset of discovery dates of 6571 unique mammal host-virus associations between 1930 and 2018. We show that virus discovery rates in mammal hosts are either constant or accelerating, with little evidence of declines towards viral richness asymptotes, even in highly sampled hosts. Consequently, inference of relative viral richness across host species has been unstable over time, particularly in bats, where intensified surveillance since the early 2000s caused a rapid rearrangement of species' ranked viral richness. Our results illustrate that comparative inference of host-level virus diversity across mammals is highly sensitive to even short-term changes in sampling effort. We advise caution to avoid overinterpreting patterns in current data, since it is feasible that an analysis conducted today could draw quite different conclusions than one conducted only a decade ago.},

Here, we characterize infection dynamics and transmissibility of a {LASV} isolate (Soromba-R) in adult lab-reared M. natalensis originating from Mali. The lab-reared M. natalenesis proved to be highly susceptible to {LASV} isolates from geographically distinct regions of West Africa via multiple routes of exposure, with 50\% infectious doses of \&lt; 1 {TCID}50. Postinoculation, {LASV} Soromba-R established a systemic infection with no signs of clinical disease. Viral {RNA} was detected in all nine tissues examined with peak concentrations detected between days 7 and 14 postinfection within most organs. There was an overall trend toward clearance of virus within 40 days of infection in most organs. The exception is lung specimens, which retained positivity throughout the course of the 85-day study. Direct (contact) and indirect (fomite) transmission experiments demonstrated 40\% of experimentally infected M. natalensis were capable of transmitting {LASV} to naïve animals, with peak transmissibility occurring between 28 and 42 days post-inoculation. No differences in patterns of infection or transmission were noted between male and female experimentally infected rodents. Adult lab-reared M. natalensis are highly susceptible to genetically distinct {LASV} strains developing a temporary asymptomatic infection associated with virus shedding resulting in contact and fomite transmission within a cohort.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of Lassa virus ({LASV}) infections in rodent reservoirs and their endemic human caseloads remain poorly understood. During the endemic period, human infections are believed to be associated with the seasonal migration of Mastomys natalensis, thought to be the primary reservoir that triggers multiple spillovers of {LASV} to humans. It has become imperative to improve {LASV} diagnosis in rodents while updating their prevalence in two regions of Lassa fever endemicity in Nigeria. Rodents (total, 942) were trapped in Ondo (531) and Ebonyi (411) states between October 2018 and April 2020 for detection of {LASV} using various tissues. Overall, the {LASV} prevalence was 53.6\%. The outbreak area sampled in Ondo had three and two times higher capture success and {LASV} prevalence, respectively, than Ebonyi State. This correlated with the higher number of annual cases of Lassa fever ({LF}) in Ondo State versus Ebonyi State. All rodent genera (Mastomys, Rattus, Crocidura, Mus, and Tatera) captured in both states showed slightly variable {LASV} positivity, with Rattus spp. being the most predominantly infected (77.3\%) rodents in Ondo State versus Mastomys spp. (41.6\%) in Ebonyi State. The tissues with the highest {LASV} positivity were the kidneys, spleen, and testes. The finding of a relatively high {LASV} prevalence in all of the rodent genera captured highlights the complex interspecies transmission dynamics of {LASV} infections in the reservoirs and their potential association with increased environmental contact, as well as the risk of zoonotic spillover in these communities, which have the highest prevalence of Lassa fever in Nigeria. {IMPORTANCE} Our findings show the highest {LASV} positivity in small rodents ever recorded and the first direct detection of {LASV} in Tatera spp. Our findings also indicate the abundance of {LASV}-infected small rodents in houses, with probable interspecies transmission through vertical and horizontal coitus routes. Consequently, we suggest that the abundance of different reservoir species for {LASV} may fuel the epizootic outbreaks of {LF} in affected human communities. The high prevalence of {LASV} with the diversity of affected rodents has direct implications for our understanding of the transmission risk, mitigation, and ultimately, the prevention of {LF} in humans. Optimal tissues for {LASV} detection in rodents are also presented.},

	abstract = {At least 10,000 virus species have the ability to infect humans but, at present, the vast majority are circulating silently in wild mammals1,2. However, changes in climate and land use will lead to opportunities for viral sharing among previously geographically isolated species of wildlife3,4. In some cases, this will facilitate zoonotic spillover—a mechanistic link between global environmental change and disease emergence. Here we simulate potential hotspots of future viral sharing, using a phylogeographical model of the mammal–virus network, and projections of geographical range shifts for 3,139 mammal species under climate-change and land-use scenarios for the year 2070. We predict that species will aggregate in new combinations at high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, causing the cross-species transmission of their associated viruses an estimated 4,000 times. Owing to their unique dispersal ability, bats account for the majority of novel viral sharing and are likely to share viruses along evolutionary pathways that will facilitate future emergence in humans. Notably, we find that this ecological transition may already be underway, and holding warming under 2 °C within the twenty-first century will not reduce future viral sharing. Our findings highlight an urgent need to pair viral surveillance and discovery efforts with biodiversity surveys tracking the range shifts of species, especially in tropical regions that contain the most zoonoses and are experiencing rapid warming.},

	abstract = {Background
In September 2017, Nigeria experienced a large outbreak of human monkeypox ({HMPX}). In this study, we report the outbreak experience and response in the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital ({NDUTH}), Bayelsa state, where the index case and majority of suspected cases were reported.

Methods
In a cross-sectional study between September 25th and 31st December 2017, we reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of all suspected and confirmed cases of {HMPX} seen at the {NDUTH} and appraised the plans, activities and challenges of the hospital in response to the outbreak based on documented observations of the hospital’s infection control committee ({IPC}). Monkeypox cases were defined using the interim national guidelines as provided by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control ({NCDC}).

Results
Of 38 suspected cases of {HMPX}, 18(47.4\%) were laboratory confirmed, 3(7.9\%) were probable, while 17 (18.4\%) did not fit the case definition for {HMPX}. Majority of the confirmed/probable cases were adults (80.9\%) and males (80.9\%). There was concomitant chicken pox, syphilis and {HIV}-1 infections in two confirmed cases and a case of nosocomial infection in one healthcare worker ({HCW}). The hospital established a make-shift isolation ward for case management, constituted a {HMPX} response team and provided {IPC} resources. At the outset, some {HCWs} were reluctant to participate in the outbreak and others avoided suspected patients. Some patients and their family members experienced stigma and discrimination and there were cases of refusal of isolation. Repeated trainings and collaborative efforts by all stakeholders addressed some of these challenges and eventually led to successful containment of the outbreak.

Conclusion
While the 2017 outbreak of human monkeypox in Nigeria was contained, our report reveals gaps in outbreak response that could serve as lessons to other hospitals to strengthen epidemic preparedness and response activities in the hospital setting.},

It is predicted that monkeypox virus will continue to be introduced into human communities from animal sources, and that the average magnitude and duration of monkeypox epidemics will increase as vaccine-derived protection declines in the population. On the other hand, current evidence Indicates that the virus is appreciably less transmissible than was smallpox, and that it will not persist In human communities, even in the total absence of vaccination.

In June–July 2011, we investigated mortality in ducks, geese and chickens with suspected H5N1 infection in a north-eastern district of the country to identify the aetiologic agent and extent of the outbreak and identify possible associated human infections. We surveyed households and farms with affected poultry flocks in six villages in Netrokona district and collected cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs from sick birds and tissue samples from dead poultry. We conducted a survey in three of these villages to identify suspected human influenza-like illness cases and collected nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. We tested all swabs by real-time {RT}-{PCR}, sequenced cultured viruses, and examined tissue samples by histopathology and immunohistochemistry to detect and characterize influenza virus infection. In the six villages, among the 240 surveyed households and 11 small-scale farms, 61\% (1789/2930) of chickens, 47\% (4816/10 184) of ducks and 73\% (358/493) of geese died within 14 days preceding the investigation. Of 70 sick poultry swabbed, 80\% (56/70) had detectable {RNA} for influenza A/H5, including 89\% (49/55) of ducks, 40\% (2/5) of geese and 50\% (5/10) of chickens. We isolated virus from six of 25 samples; sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene of these six isolates indicated clade 2.3.2.1a of H5N1 virus. Histopathological changes and immunohistochemistry staining of avian influenza viral antigens were recognized in the brain, pancreas and intestines of ducks and chickens. We identified ten human cases showing signs compatible with influenza-like illness; four were positive for influenza A/H3; however, none were positive for influenza A/H5. The recently introduced H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1a virus caused unusually high mortality in ducks and geese. Heightened surveillance in poultry is warranted to guide appropriate diagnostic testing and detect novel influenza strains.},

	abstract = {This article uses the experience of five European countries to review the integrated approaches (human, animal and vector) for surveillance and monitoring of West Nile virus ({WNV}) at national and European levels. The epidemiological situation of West Nile fever in Europe is heterogeneous. No model of surveillance and monitoring fits all, hence this article merely encourages countries to implement the integrated approach that meets their needs. Integration of surveillance and monitoring activities conducted by the public health authorities, the animal health authorities and the authorities in charge of vector surveillance and control should improve efficiency and save resources by implementing targeted measures. The creation of a formal interagency working group is identified as a crucial step towards integration. Blood safety is a key incentive for public health authorities to allocate sufficient resources for {WNV} surveillance, while the facts that an effective vaccine is available for horses and that most infected animals remain asymptomatic make the disease a lesser priority for animal health authorities. The examples described here can support other European countries wishing to strengthen their {WNV} surveillance or preparedness, and also serve as a model for surveillance and monitoring of other (vector-borne) zoonotic infections.},

Endemic circulation of Lassa virus in a new territory and the genetic diversity thus confirm that this virus represents a growing threat for West African people.

To support the extensive task of laboratory characterization, scientists may increasingly rely on data-driven rubrics or machine learning models that learn from known zoonoses to identify which animal pathogens could someday pose a threat to global health. We synthesize the findings of an interdisciplinary workshop on zoonotic risk technologies to answer the following questions. What are the prerequisites, in terms of open data, equity and interdisciplinary collaboration, to the development and application of those tools? What effect could the technology have on global health? Who would control that technology, who would have access to it and who would benefit from it? Would it improve pandemic prevention? Could it create new challenges?

Surveillance and monitoring efforts are major components for effective disease prevention and control. As human health and animal health are inextricably linked, it is assumed that a cross-sectoral data interpretation of zoonotic disease information will improve their prevention, prediction and control. To provide an overview of existing systems throughout the world which integrate information from humans and animals on zoonotic diseases, a literature review was conducted. Twenty projects were identified and described regarding their concepts and realization. They all vary widely depending on their surveillance purpose, their structure and the source of information they use. What they have in common is that they quite often use data which have already been collected for another purpose. Therefore, the challenges of how to make use of such secondary data are of great interest.},

We review what is known about the pathogens that emerge, the hosts that they originate in, and the factors that drive their emergence. We discuss challenges to their control and new efforts to predict pandemics, target surveillance to the most crucial interfaces, and identify prevention strategies. New mathematical modelling, diagnostic, communications, and informatics technologies can identify and report hitherto unknown microbes in other species, and thus new risk assessment approaches are needed to identify microbes most likely to cause human disease.

We generated a genomic catalog of almost 200 {LASV} sequences from clinical and rodent reservoir samples. We show that whereas the 2013-2015 {EVD} epidemic is fueled by human-to-human transmissions, {LASV} infections mainly result from reservoir-to-human infections. We elucidated the spread of {LASV} across West Africa and show that this migration was accompanied by changes in {LASV} genome abundance, fatality rates, codon adaptation, and translational efficiency. By investigating intrahost evolution, we found that mutations accumulate in epitopes of viral surface proteins, suggesting selection for immune escape. This catalog will serve as a foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics. {VIDEO} {ABSTRACT}. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Using a stage-structured host-pathogen model parameterized and cross-validated from a unique 15-year data set, we show how stochastic population fluctuations can lead to predictable dynamics of {SNV} in deer mice. Significant variation in host abundance and the basic reproductive number of the virus results in intermittent crossing of the critical host population density necessary for {SNV} endemicity and frequent local extinctions. When environmental conditions favor growth of the host population above the threshold, host–pathogen interactions lead to delayed density dependence in reservoir prevalence. The resultant ecological delay may provide a neglected opportunity for outbreak prediction in zoonoses.},

	abstract = {Predicting risk of zoonotic diseases, i.e., diseases shared by humans and animals, is often complicated by the population ecology of wildlife host(s). We here demonstrate how ecological knowledge of a disease system can be used for early prediction of human risk using Puumala hantavirus ({PUUV}) in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), which causes Nephropathia epidemica ({NE}) in humans, as a model system. Bank vole populations at northern latitudes exhibit multiannual fluctuations in density and spatial distribution, a phenomenon that has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, existing studies predict {NE} incidence only a few months before an outbreak. We used a time series on cyclic bank vole population density (1972–2013), their {PUUV} infection rates (1979–1986; 2003–2013), and {NE} incidence in Sweden (1990–2013). Depending on the relationship between vole density and infection prevalence (proportion of infected animals), either overall density of bank voles or the density of infected bank voles may be used to predict seasonal {NE} incidence. The density and spatial distribution of voles at density minima of a population cycle contribute to the early warning of {NE} risk later at its cyclic peak. When bank voles remain relatively widespread in the landscape during cyclic minima, {PUUV} can spread from a high baseline during a cycle, culminating in high prevalence in bank voles and potentially high {NE} risk during peak densities.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Zoonotic diseases are an increasingly important source of human infectious diseases, and host pathogen richness of reservoir host species is a critical driver of spill-over risk. Population-level traits of hosts such as population size, host density and geographic range size have all been shown to be important determinants of host pathogen richness. However, empirically identifying the independent influences of these traits has proven difficult as many of these traits directly depend on each other. Here we develop a mechanistic, metapopulation, susceptible-infected-recovered model to identify the independent influences of these population-level traits on the ability of a newly evolved pathogen to invade and persist in host populations in the presence of an endemic pathogen. We use bats as a case study as they are highly social and an important source of zoonotic disease. We show that larger populations and group sizes had a greater influence on the chances of pathogen invasion and persistence than increased host density or the number of groups. As anthropogenic change affects these traits to different extents, this increased understanding of how traits independently determine pathogen richness will aid in predicting future zoonotic spill-over risk.},

Terminally ill horses can exhibit a range of clinical signs including frothy nasal discharge, ataxia or forebrain signs. Early signs, if detected, can include depression, inappetence, colic or mild respiratory signs. All unvaccinated ill horses in areas where flying foxes exist, may potentially be infected with {HeV}, posing a significant risk to the veterinary community. Equivac® {HeV} vaccine has been fully registered in Australia since 2015 (and under an Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority special permit since 2012) for immunization of horses against {HeV} and is the most effective and direct solution to prevent disease transmission to horses and protect humans. No {HeV} vaccinated horse has tested positive for {HeV} infection. There is no registered vaccine to prevent, or therapeutics to treat, {HeV} infection in humans. Previous equine {HeV} outbreaks tended to cluster in winter overlapping with the foaling season (August to December), when veterinarians and horse owners have frequent close contact with horses and their bodily fluids, increasing the chance of zoonotic disease transmission. The most southerly case was detected in 2019 in the Upper Hunter region in New South Wales, which is Australia's Thoroughbred horse breeding capital. Future spillover events are predicted to move further south and inland in Queensland and New South Wales, aligning with the moving distribution of the main reservoir hosts. Here we (1) review {HeV} epidemiology and climate change predicted infection dynamics, (2) present a biosecurity protocol for veterinary clinics and hospitals to adopt, and (3) describe diagnostic tests currently available and those under development. Major knowledge and research gaps have been identified, including evaluation of vaccine efficacy in foals to assess current vaccination protocol recommendations.},

In this review, we propose two hypotheses for the mechanisms by which land use change can lead to viral emergence: firstly, by perturbing disease dynamics in multihost disease systems via impacts on cross-species transmission rates (the ‘perturbation’ hypothesis); and secondly, by allowing exposure of novel hosts to a rich pool of pathogen diversity (the ‘pathogen pool’ hypothesis). We discuss ways by which these two hypotheses might be tested using a combination of ecological and virological approaches, and how this may provide novel control and prevention strategies.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts that increasing biodiversity will dilute the risk of infectious diseases under certain conditions and will amplify disease risk under others. Yet, few empirical studies demonstrate amplification. This contrast may occur because few studies have considered the multivariate nature of disease risk, which includes richness and abundance of parasites with different transmission modes. By combining a multivariate statistical model developed for biodiversity–ecosystem–multifunctionality with an extensive field manipulation of host (plant) richness, composition and resource supply to hosts, we reveal that (i) host richness alone could not explain most changes in disease risk, and (ii) shifting host composition allowed disease amplification, depending on parasite transmission mode. Specifically, as predicted from theory, the effect of host diversity on parasite abundance differed for microbes (more density-dependent transmission) and insects (more frequency-dependent transmission). Host diversity did not influence microbial parasite abundance, but nearly doubled insect parasite abundance, and this amplification effect was attributable to variation in host composition. Parasite richness was reduced by resource addition, but only in species-rich host communities. Overall, this study demonstrates that multiple drivers, related to both host community and parasite characteristics, can influence disease risk. Furthermore, it provides a framework for evaluating multivariate disease risk in other systems.},

Here, we combined field infection data from 2,191 amphibian hosts representing 158 parasite assemblages with mechanistic experiments to evaluate the influence of parasite richness on both parasite transmission and host fitness. Using a guild of larval trematode parasites (six species) and an amphibian host, our experiments contrasted the effects of parasite richness vs. composition, observed vs. randomized assemblages, and additive vs. replacement designs. Consistent with the dilution effect hypothesis extended to intrahost diversity, increases in parasite richness reduced overall infection success, including infections by the most virulent parasite. However, the effects of parasite richness on host growth and survival were context dependent; pathology increased when parasites were administered additively, even when the presence of the most pathogenic species was held constant, but decreased when added species replaced or reduced virulent species, emphasizing the importance of community composition and assembly. These results were similar or stronger when community structures were weighted by their observed frequencies in nature. The field data also revealed the highly nested structure of parasite assemblages, with virulent species generally occupying basal positions, suggesting that increases in parasite richness and antagonism in nature will decrease virulent infections. Our findings emphasize the importance of parasite biodiversity and coinfection in affecting epidemiological responses and highlight the value of integrating research on biodiversity and community ecology for understanding infectious diseases.},

The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome ({MERS}) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an {HCoV} infection could be. The emergence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted {CoVs} into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister {SARS}-{CoV}. {HCoV} infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of {HCoVs} would serve us well. Most {HCoVs} originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some {HCoVs} are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating {CoV}-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on {CoV} pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven {HCoVs}, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different {HCoVs} from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current {CoV} disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Based on findings demonstrating the simian ancestry of {HIV}, {AIDS} has been reported to be a zoonosis. However, this theory has never been proved and must seriously be questioned. Several arguments show that {HIV}-{AIDS} is not a zoonosis. (i) If {AIDS} were a zoonosis, there must be evidence of {AIDS} being directly acquired from an animal species, as is rabies, a disease that is directly acquired from animals. (ii) Despite long-term and frequent human exposure to {SIV}-infected monkeys in Africa, only 11 cross-species transmission events are known, and only four of these have resulted in significant human-to-human transmission, generating {HIV}-1 groups M and O and {HIV}-2 groups A and B. The closest relatives of {SIVcpz} ({HIV}-1 group N) and of {SIVsm} ({HIV}-2 groups C–H) are extremely rare, with only six {HIV}-1 group N-infected patients and only single individuals known to be infected by {HIV}-2 groups C–H. {SIV}, while capable of cross-species transmission, is thus poorly adapted for disease and epidemic spread. If {AIDS} were a zoonosis that is capable of significant human-to-human spread, there would be a plethora of founder subtypes and groups. (iii) Human exposure to {SIV} is thousands of years old, but {AIDS} emerged only in the 20th century. If {AIDS} were a zoonosis that spread into the human population, it would have spread to the West during slave trade. (iv) Experimental transmission of {SIVs} to different species of monkeys is often well controlled by the new host, showing that the virus and not the disease is transmitted. Therefore, we conclude that cross-species transmission of {SIV} does not in itself constitute the basis for a zoonosis. Transmission per se is not the major requirement for the generation of the {AIDS} epidemic. All {HIVs} do derive from simian species, but {AIDS} does not qualify as a zoonosis and this explanation cannot in itself account for the origin of {AIDS} epidemic. It is important to distinguish {AIDS} from true zoonoses (e.g. rabies) because research is needed to understand the processes by which animal viruses cause sustained human-to-human transmission, epidemics and even pandemics. Much is known about emerging viruses, but almost nothing is known about emerging viral diseases.},

To assess this threat, we reviewed published evidence of human-to-wildlife transmission events, with a focus on how such events could threaten animal and human health. We identified 97 verified examples, involving a wide range of pathogens; however, reported hosts were mostly non-human primates or large, long-lived captive animals. Relatively few documented examples resulted in morbidity and mortality, and very few led to maintenance of a human pathogen in a new reservoir or subsequent “secondary spillover” back into humans. We discuss limitations in the literature surrounding these phenomena, including strong evidence of sampling bias towards non-human primates and human-proximate mammals and the possibility of systematic bias against reporting human parasites in wildlife, both of which limit our ability to assess the risk of human-to-wildlife pathogen transmission. We outline how researchers can collect experimental and observational evidence that will expand our capacity for risk assessment for human-to-wildlife pathogen transmission.},

Here, we use existing {MERS}-{CoV} sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term {MERS}-{CoV} evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times, we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels.

Meanwhile, vector-transmitted, chronic, and protozoan infections have been neglected, as have crucial processes such as cross-species transmission. Progress in understanding and combating zoonoses requires a new generation of models that addresses a broader set of pathogen life histories and integrates across host species and scientific disciplines.},

In the current review we highlight an important series of wildlife {EIDs}: amphibian chytridiomycosis; diseases of marine invertebrates and vertebrates and two recently-emerged viral zoonoses, Nipah virus disease and West Nile virus disease. These exemplify the varied etiology, pathogenesis, zoonotic potential and ecological impact of wildlife {EIDs}. Strikingly similar underlying factors drive disease emergence in both human and wildlife populations. These are predominantly ecological and almost entirely the product of human environmental change. The implications of wildlife {EIDs} are twofold: emerging wildlife diseases cause direct and indirect loss of biodiversity and add to the threat of zoonotic disease emergence. Since human environmental changes are largely responsible for their emergence, the threats wildlife {EIDs} pose to biodiversity and human health represent yet another consequence of anthropogenic influence on ecosystems. We identify key areas where existing expertise in ecology, conservation biology, wildlife biology, veterinary medicine and the impact of environmental change would augment programs to investigate emerging diseases of humans, and we comment on the need for greater medical and microbiological input into the study of wildlife diseases.},

	abstract = {Background

Because of complex interactions of climate variables at the levels of the pathogen, vector, and host, the potential influence of climate change on vector-borne and zoonotic diseases ({VBZDs}) is poorly understood and difficult to predict. Climate effects on the nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases are especially obscure and have received scant treatment.

Objective

We described known and potential effects of climate change on {VBZDs} and proposed specific studies to increase our understanding of these effects. The nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases have received scant treatment and are emphasized in this paper.

Data sources and synthesis

We used a review of the existing literature and extrapolations from observations of short-term climate variation to suggest potential impacts of climate change on {VBZDs}. Using public health priorities on climate change, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we developed six specific goals for increasing understanding of the interaction between climate and {VBZDs} and for improving capacity for predicting climate change effects on incidence and distribution of {VBZDs}.

Conclusions

Climate change may affect the incidence of {VBZDs} through its effect on four principal characteristics of host and vector populations that relate to pathogen transmission to humans: geographic distribution, population density, prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens, and the pathogen load in individual hosts and vectors. These mechanisms may interact with each other and with other factors such as anthropogenic disturbance to produce varying effects on pathogen transmission within host and vector populations and to humans. Because climate change effects on most {VBZDs} act through wildlife hosts and vectors, understanding these effects will require multidisciplinary teams to conduct and interpret ecosystem-based studies of {VBZD} pathogens in host and vector populations and to identify the hosts, vectors, and pathogens with the greatest potential to affect human populations under climate change scenarios.},

In this paper, we examine mechanisms by which climate change can affect various ecological factors that are likely to drive an increase in the overall incidence as well as the frequency of outbreaks of leptospirosis. We will discuss the geographical areas that are most likely to be at risk of an increase in leptospirosis disease burden owing to the coexistence of climate change hazard risk, environmental drivers of leptospirosis outbreaks, local socioeconomic circumstances, and social and demographic trends. To reduce this disease burden, enhanced surveillance and further research is required to understand the environmental drivers of infection, to build capacity in emergency response and to promote community adaptation to a changing climate.},

In Argentina, some regions have climatic and geographical characteristics that favor the habitat of bacteria of the Leptospira genus, whose survival strongly depends on climatic factors, enhanced by climate change, which increase the problems associated with people’s health. In order to have a method to predict leptospirosis cases, in this paper, five time series forecasting methods are compared: two parametric (autoregressive integrated moving average and an alternative one that allows covariates, {ARIMA} and {ARIMAX}, respectively), two nonparametric (Nadaraya-Watson Kernel estimator, one and two kernels versions, {NW}-1 K and {NW}-2 K), and one semiparametric (semi-functional partial linear regression, {SFPLR}) method. For this, the number of cases of leptospirosis registered from 2009 to 2020 in three important cities of northeastern Argentina is used, as well as hydroclimatic covariates related to the presence of cases. According to the obtained results, there is no method that improves considerably the rest and can be recommended as a unique tool for leptospirosis prediction. However, in general, the {NW}-2 K method gets a better performance. This work, in addition to using a long-term high-quality time series, enriches the area of applications of statistical models to epidemiological leptospirosis data by the incorporation of hydroclimatic variables, and it is recommended directing further efforts in this line of research, under the context of current climate change.},

	abstract = {Background
In Europe, the frequency, intensity, and geographic range of West Nile virus ({WNV})-outbreaks have increased over the past decade, with a 7.2-fold increase in 2018 compared to 2017, and a markedly expanded geographic area compared to 2010. The reasons for this increase and range expansion remain largely unknown due to the complexity of the transmission pathways and underlying disease drivers. In a first, we use advanced artificial intelligence to disentangle the contribution of eco-climatic drivers to {WNV}-outbreaks across Europe using decade-long (2010-2019) data at high spatial resolution.
Methods
We use a high-performance machine learning classifier, {XGBoost} ({eXtreme} gradient boosting) combined with state-of-the-art {XAI} ({eXplainable} artificial intelligence) methodology to describe the predictive ability and contribution of different drivers of the emergence and transmission of {WNV}-outbreaks in Europe, respectively.
Findings
Our model, trained on 2010-2017 data achieved an {AUC} (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) score of 0.97 and 0.93 when tested with 2018 and 2019 data, respectively, showing a high discriminatory power to classify a {WNV}-endemic area. Overall, positive summer/spring temperatures anomalies, lower water availability index ({NDWI}), and drier winter conditions were found to be the main determinants of {WNV}-outbreaks across Europe. The climate trends of the preceding year in combination with eco-climatic predictors of the first half of the year provided a robust predictive ability of the entire transmission season ahead of time. For the extraordinary 2018 outbreak year, relatively higher spring temperatures and the abundance of Culex mosquitoes were the strongest predictors, in addition to past climatic trends.
Interpretation
Our {AI}-based framework can be deployed to trigger rapid and timely alerts for active surveillance and vector control measures in order to intercept an imminent {WNV}-outbreak in Europe.

Many diseases of tropical origin, including West Nile virus ({WNV}), are sensitive to climate and likely to change their distributions in the coming decades. The 1999 outbreak of {WNV} in North America is an example of rapid viral adaptation to a new geographic area while recent outbreaks in Europe demonstrate the capacity of multiple viral strains to expand rapidly. {WNV} is one of the most widely distributed arboviruses and has displayed high rates of mutability, adaptability, and virulence. Northward expansion of {WNV} is happening in Europe and North America and may make {WNV} an increasingly worrying health risk at higher latitudes. Circumpolar northward expansion of {WNV}’s enzootic range appears unlikely over the coming century—at least for sustained enzootic transmission—but isolated and ephemeral transmission events might occur if the virus were to be introduced by migrating birds during warm months. Human populations in this area are at greater risk for health impacts from {WNV} transmission due to limited healthcare in rural areas, higher underlying morbidity in indigenous populations, and prolonged human-environment interactions (in populations engaging in traditional lifestyles). This review presents a multidisciplinary synthesis on {WNV} and climate change, potential for {WNV} expansion, and the vulnerability of the circumpolar north. {WIREs} Clim Change 2016, 7:283–300. doi: 10.1002/wcc.382 This article is categorized under: Assessing Impacts of Climate Change {\textgreater} Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change},

We conducted a systematic review 305 scientific articles investigating how specific types of anthropogenic land use change influence infectious disease dynamics. We summarized findings, highlighted common themes, and drew attention to neglected areas of research. There was an increase in publications on this topic over the last 30 years spanning diseases of humans, livestock, and wildlife, including a large number of zoonotic pathogens. Most papers (66.9\%) were observational, 30.8\% were review or concept papers, and few studies (2.3\%) were experimental in nature, with most studies focusing on vector-borne and/or multi-host pathogens. Common land use change types related to disease transmission were deforestation/forest fragmentation/habitat fragmentation, agricultural development/irrigation, and urbanization/suburbanization. In response to anthropogenic change, more than half of the studies (56.9\%) documented increased pathogen transmission, 10.4\% of studies observed decreased pathogen transmission, 30.4\% had variable and complex pathogen responses, and 2.4\% showed no detectable changes. Commonly reported mechanisms by which land use change altered infectious disease transmission included alteration of the vector, host, and pathogen niche, changes in host and vector community composition, changes in behavior or movement of vectors and/or hosts, altered spatial distribution of hosts and/or vectors, and socioeconomic factors, and environmental contamination. We discussed observed patterns in the literature and make suggestions for future research directions, emphasizing the importance of ecological and evolutionary theory to understand pathogen responses in changing landscapes.},

	abstract = {Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility.},

The natural reservoir for Nipah virus and related members of the genus Henipavirus are fruit bats of the genus Pteropus. Nipah virus emerged in Malaysia in 1998 as a porcine neurologic and respiratory disease that spread to humans who had contact with live, infected pigs. Research reviewed in this paper suggests that anthropogenic factors, including agricultural expansion and intensification, were the underlying causes of its emergence.

While the dilution effect predicts that pathogen prevalence is negatively correlated with increased species diversity, the opposite trend is observed when the amplification effect occurs. Understanding how interspecific interactions such as predation and competition within a community influence disease transmission is highly relevant. We explore the conditions under which the dilution and amplification effects arise, using compartmental models that integrate ecological and epidemiological interactions. We formulate an intraguild predation model where each species is divided into two compartments: susceptible and infected individuals. We obtained that increasing predation increases the disease transmission potential of the predator and the density of infected individuals, but decreases the disease transmission potential of the prey, as well as their density. Also, we found that interspecific competition always helps to decrease the number of infected individuals in the population of the two species. Therefore, dilution and amplification effects can be observed simultaneously but depending on different types of cological interactions.},

The database consisted of 1415 pathogens causing disease in humans, 616 in livestock and 374 in domestic carnivores. Multihost pathogens were very prevalent among human pathogens (61.6\%) and even more so among domestic mammal pathogens (livestock 77.3\%, carnivores 90.0\%).

Across all these groups, helminths and fungi were relatively unlikely to emerge whereas viruses, particularly {RNA} viruses, were highly likely to emerge. The ability of a pathogen to infect multiple hosts, particularly hosts in other taxonomic orders or wildlife, were also risk factors for emergence in human and livestock pathogens.

Population biology has yet to explain why perceived evolutionary advantages of pathogen specialization are, in practice, outweighed by those of generalization. Factors that predispose pathogens to generalism include high levels of genetic diversity and abundant opportunities for cross-species transmission, and the taxonomic distributions of generalists and specialists appear to reflect these factors. Generalism also has consequences for the evolution of virulence and for pathogen epidemiology, making both much less predictable. The evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of generalism are so finely balanced that even closely related pathogens can have very different host range sizes.},

	abstract = {The notion that certain animal groups disproportionately maintain and transmit viruses to humans due to broad-scale differences in ecology, life history, and physiology currently influences global health surveillance and research in disease ecology, virology, and immunology. To directly test whether such “special reservoirs” of zoonoses exist, we used literature searches to construct the largest existing dataset of virus–reservoir relationships, consisting of the avian and mammalian reservoir hosts of 415 {RNA} and {DNA} viruses along with their histories of human infection. Reservoir host effects on the propensity of viruses to have been reported as infecting humans were rare and when present were restricted to one or two viral families. The data instead support a largely host-neutral explanation for the distribution of human-infecting viruses across the animal orders studied. After controlling for higher baseline viral richness in mammals versus birds, the observed number of zoonoses per animal order increased as a function of their species richness. Animal orders of established importance as zoonotic reservoirs including bats and rodents were unexceptional, maintaining numbers of zoonoses that closely matched expectations for mammalian groups of their size. Our findings show that variation in the frequency of zoonoses among animal orders can be explained without invoking special ecological or immunological relationships between hosts and viruses, pointing to a need to reconsider current approaches aimed at finding and predicting novel zoonoses.},

Strategies are needed to identify and characterize animal viruses that pose the greatest risk of spillover and spread in humans and inform public health interventions. Using expert opinion and scientific evidence, we identified host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, {SpillOver}, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from testing 509,721 samples from 74,635 animals as part of a virus discovery project and public records of virus detections around the world, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. Validating the risk assessment, the top 12 were known zoonotic viruses, including {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Several newly detected wildlife viruses ranked higher than known zoonotic viruses. Using a scientifically informed process, we capitalized on the recent wealth of virus discovery data to systematically identify and prioritize targets for investigation. The publicly accessible {SpillOver} platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. {SpillOver} is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health.},

Together, these shortcomings suggest that attempts to assess zoonotic risk using available virological data are likely to be inaccurate and largely only identify those host taxa that have been studied most extensively. We suggest that virus surveillance at the human–animal interface may be more productive., Determining which organisms harbour viruses that could potentially infect humans is of great topical interest.

Analysis of what we know of the origins of 10 tropical and 15 temperate infectious diseases reveals that animals were the source of the majority of important human diseases in the recent past, and that direct contact with animals through activities such as hunting remains a major route for disease acquisition. Modern developments such as industrial food production, vaccine production and blood transfusion may be making us more vulnerable than ever to new pathogens. The authors argue that people with high exposure to wild animals, such as hunters, zoo workers and wildlife veterinarians, should be regularly screened for emergent pathogens.This would provide early warning of newly introduced disease, and supply a repository of tissue samples that would assist in reconstructing the origin of later outbreaks.},

We carried out a global examination of distributions of all nonmarine mammals to determine patterns of species richness, endemism, and endangerment, and to evaluate the degree of congruence among hotspots of these three measures of diversity in mammals. We then compare congruence of hotspots in two animal groups (mammals and birds) to assess the generality of these patterns. We defined hotspots as the richest 2.5\% of cells in a global equal-area grid comparable to 1° latitude × 1° longitude. Hotspots of species richness, “endemism,” and extinction threat were noncongruent. Only 1\% of cells and 16\% of species were common to the three types of mammalian hotspots. Congruence increased with increases in both the geographic scope of the analysis and the percentage of cells defined as being hotspots. The within-mammal hotspot noncongruence was similar to the pattern recently found for birds. Thus, assigning global conservation priorities based on hotspots is at best a limited strategy.},

The most obvious example of this change is the huge expansion of human numbers: four billion have been added since 1950. Projections for the next half century expect a highly divergent world, with stagnation or potential decline in parts of the developed world and continued rapid growth in the least developed regions. Other demographic processes are also undergoing extraordinary change: women's fertility has dropped rapidly and life expectancy has risen to new highs. Past trends in fertility and mortality have led to very young populations in high fertility countries in the developing world and to increasingly older populations in the developed world. Contemporary societies are now at very different stages of their demographic transitions. This paper summarizes key trends in population size, fertility and mortality, and age structures during these transitions. The focus is on the century from 1950 to 2050, which covers the period of most rapid global demographic transformation.},

The common notion of desertification is of an advancing “desert,” a generally irreversible anthropogenic process. This process has been linked to increased surface albedo, increased dust generation, and reduced productivity of the land. This study demonstrates that there has been no progressive change of either the Saharan boundary or vegetation cover in the Sahel during the last 16 years, nor has there been a systematic reduction of “productivity” as assessed by the water-use efficiency of the vegetation cover. While it also showed little change in surface albedo during the years analyzed, this study suggests that a change in albedo of up to 0.10\% since the 1950s is conceivable.},

	abstract = {This brief presents a factual and retrospective analysis of the relationships between urbanisation and demography in North Africa and West Africa. It shows that the process of demographic transition is now fully underway in this region. North of the Sahara the new demographic equilibrium features a birth rate higher than expected, according to theoretical model predictions, resulting in continuous population growth. Over 70\% of the population now lives in cities, a number that is expected to continue to rise in the coming decades. South of the Sahara all countries have seen death rates plummet, followed by a decrease in birth rates. The gap between the change in the two variables has contributed to spectacular natural growth in the space of a few decades. This growth is occurring in parallel with a redistribution of populations to urban areas, which are now home to close to one of every two inhabitants. West African urbanisation is likely to accelerate the social, economic and political changes that favour the demographic transition. One of the main challenges facing the region is the question of how to reduce the regional variations seen in fertility rates between the continent’s urban and rural areas.},

	abstract = {This contribution critically explores changing relationships between diamond mining and patterns of urbanisation in Sierra Leone. In providing an historical overview of mining expansion and contraction, the paper highlights the significant impacts that mining has had on the rural–urban continuum, and how this has shaped political, economic and social change in diamondiferous regions. Focusing on Kono District, the effects of diamond mining on populations are evaluated before, during and after the civil war, demonstrating how diamonds have had diverse and varying impacts on both population mobility and urban agglomeration at different points in time. While much attention has focused on the social consequences of wartime displacement from diamondiferous areas to the capital city, Freetown, recent research suggests that the post-war return of young people to diamond mining regions has had unexpected consequences. Most significantly, a decline in artisanal mining activities and the rise of large-scale industrial mining has reawakened the interest of young ex-miners in farming, especially those who enjoy hereditary land rights. While one consequence of the war may be that the population is now more urban and more mobile, the paper concludes that the return of young people to their villages of origin, and rapprochement with local chiefs, may be helping to drive a resurgence of community-based cooperation in Kono District, a development which could provide a more durable basis for sustainable and democratic development in the years to come.},

	shorttitle = {Regulating agricultural intensification},
	abstract = {Motivation Imports of pesticides, especially herbicides, almost tripled in value across West Africa between 2005 and 2015. This remarkable increase has been driven by falling prices of generic pesticides, rising costs of farm labour for weeding, rising demand for farm produce, and the recent invasion of an exotic pest from the Americas, the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). Despite rapid growth in pesticide markets, policy enforcement has not kept pace. As a result, fraudulent pesticides—often underdosed—now account for roughly one-third of pesticides sold in the region. Fraud on this scale compromises agricultural growth, human health and environmental safety. Purpose This article aims to assess the consequences of rapidly growing pesticide markets for farmers, traders and policy-makers. Approach and methods Seven national studies of pesticide markets and policy implementation—in Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal—provide empirical evidence for this article. Following reviews of existing documents and statistics, each study involved structured interviews with regulators, policy-makers, traders and farmers. Multiple feedback sessions with key regional stakeholder groups vetted core findings. Findings The investigations reveal rapid changes in the structure and performance of pesticide supply chains, including a major proliferation of generic brands and unlicensed traders, high levels of fraud, and wide variability in pesticide quality. In response, four broad regulatory models are emerging across Africa: (1) purely national testing, registration and monitoring; (2) harmonized regional protocols for testing, with national registration and monitoring; (3) regional testing and registration with national monitoring; and (4) regional testing, registration and monitoring. Purely national models are most common, but they prove costly for Africa’s many small countries. In all models, weaknesses in post-registration monitoring and enforcement mean that risks to human health and the environment go largely unmonitored. Policy implications The findings suggest several practical avenues for improving agricultural input quality and environmental safety. In the short term, stakeholder coalitions of responsible traders, farmer groups and regulators can campaign for authentic products, researchers need to step up environmental monitoring of pesticide use and impacts, and pest control specialists appear poised to continue encouraging integrated pest management to economize on use of chemicals. In the medium term, moves to regional harmonization and co-operation reduce opportunities for smuggling and enable regional pooling of scarce technical personnel, while policy-makers seek feasible ways of expanding resources for registration and monitoring systems commensurate with the rapid increases in pesticide use. In political economy terms, current pest invasions open a window of opportunity potentially enabling necessary structural reform of pesticide policies and regulatory systems.},

	abstract = {Many human ebolavirus outbreaks have been linked to contact with wildlife including nonhuman primates and bats, which are assumed to serve as host species. However, it is largely unknown to what extent other animal species, particularly livestock, are involved in the transmission cycle or act as additional hosts for filoviruses. Pigs were identified as a susceptible host for Reston virus with subsequent transmission to humans reported in the Philippines. To date, there is no evidence of natural Ebola virus ({EBOV}) infection in pigs, although pigs were shown to be susceptible to {EBOV} infection under experimental settings. To investigate the potential role of pigs in the ecology of {EBOV}, we analyzed 400 porcine serum samples from Sierra Leone for the presence of ebolavirus-specific antibodies. Three samples reacted with ebolavirus nucleoproteins but had no neutralizing antibodies. Our results (1) suggest the circulation of ebolaviruses in swine in Sierra Leone that are antigenically related but not identical to {EBOV} and (2) could represent undiscovered ebolaviruses with unknown pathogenic and/or zoonotic potential.},

	abstract = {Background
Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever endemic in Nigeria. Improved surveillance and testing capacity have revealed in an increased number of reported cases and apparent geographic spread of Lassa fever in Nigeria. We described the recent four-year trend of Lassa fever in Nigeria to improve understanding of its epidemiology and inform the design of appropriate interventions.

Methods
We analysed the national surveillance data on Lassa fever maintained by the Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control ({NCDC}) and described trends, sociodemographic, geographic distribution, and clinical outcomes. We compared cases, positivity, and clinical outcomes in the period January 2018 to December 2021.

Results
We found Lassa fever to be reported throughout the year with more than half the cases reported within the first quarter of the year, a recent increase in numbers and geographic spread of the virus, and male and adult ({\textgreater}18 years) preponderance. Case fatality rates were worse in males, the under-five and elderly, during off-peak periods, and among low reporting states.

Conclusion
Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria with a recent increase in numbers and geographical distribution. Sustaining improved surveillance, enhanced laboratory diagnosis and improved case management capacity during off-peak periods should remain a priority. Attention should be paid to the very young and elderly during outbreaks. Further research efforts should identify and address specific factors that determine poor clinical outcomes.},

The implications of these fluctuations for zoonotic spillover remain poorly understood. Here, we report a global empirical analysis of data describing the linkages between habitat use, population fluctuations and zoonotic reservoir status in rodents. Our quantitative synthesis is based on data collated from papers and databases. We show that the magnitude of population fluctuations combined with species’ synanthropy and degree of human exploitation together distinguish most rodent reservoirs at a global scale, a result that was consistent across all pathogen types and pathogen transmission modes. Our spatial analyses identified hotspots of high transmission risk, including regions where reservoir species dominate the rodent community. Beyond rodents, these generalities inform our understanding of how natural and anthropogenic factors interact to increase the risk of zoonotic spillover in a rapidly changing world.},

	abstract = {With almost 2,600 species, Rodentia is the most diverse order of mammals. Here, we provide an overview of changes in our understanding of the systematics of living rodents, including species recognition and delimitation, phylogenetics, and classification, with emphasis on the last three decades. Roughly, this corresponds to the {DNA} sequencing era of rodent systematics, but the field is undergoing a transition into the genomic era. At least 248 species were newly described in the period 2000–2017, including novelties such as the first living member of Diatomyidae and a murid species without molars (Paucidentomys vermidax), thus highlighting the fact that our understanding of rodent diversity is going through an age of discovery. Mito-nuclear discordance (including that resulting from mitochondrial introgression) has been detected in some of the few taxonomic studies that have assessed variation of two or more unlinked loci. As studies incorporate more loci, incomplete lineage sorting and introgression are likely to gain recognition as widespread phenomena in the near future. Molecular phylogenetics has had a major impact in rodent phylogeny and allowed the identification of three major rodent clades, here recognized as suborders: 1) the Hystricomorpha (sometimes referred as the Ctenohystrica) and including two infraorders, Hystricognathi and Ctenodactylomorphi; 2) the Sciuromorpha; and 3) the Supramyomorpha, a new suborder that comprises the infraorders Castorimorphi, Anomalurimorphi, and Myomorphi. In spite of the greater understanding and ensuing stability of rodent phylogeny gained during the last three decades, several major areas of the rodent tree remain unresolved or poorly supported. We expect that the analysis of genomic-scale data will help resolve those areas of the radiation of Rodentia that still remain poorly understood.},
