# Land use gradients drive spatial variation in Lassa fever host communities in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. {#chapter3}


## Preface {-}


I conceived of the study with Richard Kock, Deborah Watson-Jones and Kate E. Jones. I designed the rodent trapping methodology, study protocol and formulated the data collection tool. I designated the locations of the rodent trapping grids, compiled the taxonomic keys and trained the local fieldwork collaborators on the study processes. The local fieldwork team, including Dianah Sondufu, Joyce Lamin, Michael Dawson, Momoh Jimmy and James Koninga conducted repeat sampling at previously designated locations under my direct and indirect supervision. Umaru Bangura trained me on the molecular identification of rodent and shrew species and provided remote support to this work conducted in Sierra Leone. I trained Joseph Lahai in Sierra Leone on DNA extraction from rodent and shrew samples and he prepared samples for sequencing under my direct and indirect supervision. I performed statistical analysis and interpreted model outputs with support from Rory Gibb. I received support for my work in Sierra Leone from Rashid Ansumana. I wrote this chapter and Rory Gibb, Richard Kock, Deborah Watson-Jones and Kate E. Jones contributed to and approved the final version. 

This chapter in modified format is being prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.


## Abstract  


The natal multimammate mouse (*Mastomys natalensis*) is the reservoir host species of the zoonosis, Lassa fever (*Lassa mammarenavirus*). The spatial occurrence and abundance of this rodent species is regulated by the human environment and biotic interactions within small mammal communities. However, little is known about these effects even in highly endemic areas of Lassa fever. Here, we conducted a rodent trapping study in a Lassa endemic region within the Eastern Province, Sierra Leone to understand how *M. natalensis* is distributed across a gradient of landuse types and how its distribution may be influenced by the small mammal community structure. Using data from 43,226 trap nights from four village sites between 2020-2023, we developed a Bayesian multiple species occupancy model, accounting for imperfect detection, to show that, locally within study sites, *M. natalensis* occupancy increased along a gradient from less to more human dominated habitats (i.e., from forest through agriculture to village), but that this effect did not hold at broader spatial scales, with lower occupancy in peri-urban than rural study sites. Interactions with invasive rodent species within the small mammal community appeared to regulate the occupancy of *M. natalensis*, with the presence of *Mus musculus*, but not *Rattus rattus* associated with a reduced probability of occupancy of *M. natalensis*. This finding may help to explain prior observations of lower-than-expected human cases of Lassa fever from urban settings in endemic regions. Our findings highlight that land use drives spatial heterogeneity in rodent reservoir populations, through impacting both habitat and small mammal community dynamics, with implications for the hazard of Lassa fever outbreaks. Therefore, to quantify public health risk and effectively allocate limited healthcare resources more accurate characterisation of rodent communities is required in regions at risk of Lassa fever outbreaks.


## Introduction



Global mammalian biodiversity is declining, with varied direct effects of biodiversity change on the risk of zoonosis to human populations [@sala_global_2000; @mantyka-pringle_climate_2015; @ipbes_workshop_2020]. Land use change is identified as a key driver in the decline of multiple measures of mammalian species biodiversity including; taxonomic diversity (the number and relative abundance of taxa), functional biodiversity (an increase in the abundance of generalist, synanthropic animals) and interaction diversity (the biotic interactions among species) [@naeem_functions_2012; @glidden_human-mediated_2021]. Specifically, within rodent associated zoonoses systems, conversion of natural habitats to agricultural or urban ecosystems preferentially favours, generalist, synanthropic species, more likely to be hosts of zoonoses increasing the potential prevalence of pathogens within human dominated environments [@young_declines_2014; @gibb_zoonotic_2020].


The role of mammalian community structure in zoonosis spillover risk is complex. The "Dilution effect" posits that increased species taxonomic diversity reduces pathogen prevalence within a system, therefore reducing spillover risk [@keesing_effects_2006]. In contrast, the "Amplification effect" proposes that infectious disease transmission may be increased in species rich systems [@randolph_pangloss_2012]. A greater mechanistic understanding of the association of biodiversity, beyond species richness, incorporating community structure, biotic interactions between species and differential responses to anthropogenic land use change is required [@salkeld_meta-analysis_2013; @glidden_human-mediated_2021]. These approaches have only been taken for a few rodent associated zoonoses.


Rodents are identified as an important mammalian host taxa for zoonotic diseases [@han_rodent_2015; @mendoza_does_2019]. Rodent associated zoonoses where the mechanistic contribution of community structure, biotic interactions between species and the effect of land use change includes Lyme disease (caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato*). Here, reduction in predation pressure - driven by land use change - on rodent species' has led to increased abundance of the rodent reservoir species, subsequently increasing pathogen abundance and spillover risk [@ostfeld_are_2004]. The effect of land use change on rodent communities has also been investigated in an East African setting, where conversion to agricultural land was associated with a reduction in small mammal diversity, but no general trend in the prevalence of multiple zoonotic pathogens [@young_interacting_2017]. These examples, along with others, suggest an idiosyncratic response to zoonotic disease risk in response to land use change [@mendoza_does_2019]. The effect of land use change on rodent communities in the Lassa fever disease system in West Africa has only been explored in a limited geographic area of the endemic region, with most studies focusing on the role of the rodent reservoir [@fichet-calvet_spatial_2005; @fichet-calvet_diversity_2009; @fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_small_2018; @arruda_niche_2021].


Lassa fever, caused by *Lassa mammarenavirus* (LASV) is an endemic zoonosis in eight West African countries (Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Benin, Ghana and Togo) [@world_health_organisation_lassa_2022]. There burden of this zoonosis on human communities is unclear with large uncertainties around estimates of the annual number human of infections between 100,000-900,00 [@mccormick_prospective_1987; @basinski_bridging_2021]. Most infections remain undetected and it is estimated that up-to 80% of these infections are pauci- or asymptomatic [@mccormick_prospective_1987]. Few infections are expected to lead to clinically severe cases but outcomes in confirmed clinical cases remain poor, with a reported case fatality rate of 16.5% [@simons_lassa_2022]. Within the endemic region locations of disease outbreaks are spatially heterogeneous, the cause of this is not well understood [@gibb_understanding_2017; @agbonlahor_52_2021; @grant_seroprevalence_2023].


A potential driver of the observed spatial heterogeneity in Lassa fever outbreaks may be the distribution of the the reservoir host, *Mastomys natalensis*. This commensal, synanthropic rodent species is found in 13 of 14 continental West African nations (the species has not been reported from The Gambia) and in all other sub-Saharan African countries [@iucn_iucn_2016]. It is abundant in and around areas of human-dominated landscapes where it is considered a pest species [@leirs_productivity_1993]. The introduction of invasive commensal rodent species (i.e., *Rattus rattus* and *Mus musculus*) has led to increased competition for resources and displacement of *M. natalensis* from some locations within its natural range [@garba_spatial_2014; @cuypers_no_2017]. Population dynamics within this reservoir species have been shown to be associated with resource availability and rainfall pulses (with increased abundance at the beginning of the dry season) [@leirs_forecasting_1996; @leirs_stochastic_1997]. These environmental factors are closely associated with outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations [@redding_geographical_2021]. However, this does not explain the spatial discontinuity of these outbreaks and a dearth of longitudinal, high intensity rodent trapping studies incorporating rodent community structure limits understanding of the fine scale spatial distribution of *M. natalensis* [@basinski_bridging_2021; @simons_rodent_2023].


*Mastomys natalensis* occurs within species rich settings in West Africa [@fichet-calvet_diversity_2009]. Biotic interactions between this species and other native and invasive rodents within communities and how this structure may regulate *M. natalensis* occurrence are not well described in the Lassa fever endemic region [@garba_spatial_2014; @hima_native_2019]. Outside of the endemic region the invasion of *R. rattus* and *M. musculus* have been shown to alter rodent communities leading to local exclusion of native rodent species [@dalecky_range_2015; @lippens_genetic_2017]. If these processes occur within the LASV endemic region this may have important implications for pathogen prevalence, and therefore the subsequent risk of observed disease outbreaks, as competent hosts of LASV are replaced by less competent hosts. Further, land use change may facilitate establishment of these invasive species promoting restructuring of these communities [@wells_shifts_2014; @jeffrey_rodent_1977; @benedek_responses_2018].


Sierra Leone is associated with frequent outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations, with evidence of outbreaks beyond the traditionally accepted endemic region [@grant_seroprevalence_2023]. Studies of rodent ecology within Sierra Leone have generally focused solely on the occurrence of *M. natalensis* through targeted (i.e., in response to a human outbreak of Lassa fever) or opportunistic rodent trapping [@monath_lassa_1974; @keenlyside_case-control_1983; @mccormick_prospective_1987; @bonner_poor_2007]. The structure of rodent communities in this region is not well understood and there is limited evidence of the spatial occurrence of invasive rodent species [@bonwitt_at_2017; @bangura_lassa_2021]. Within this setting the association of anthropogenic land use change on the composition of rodent communities has not been described, limiting the ability to infer the effect of land use change on current and future disease risk. There is therefore a pressing need for systematic rodent community studies to better characterise the spatial occurrence of *M. natalensis* within the wider rodent community to improve models of LASV host distributions.


Here, we conducted repeated, systematic, rodent trapping in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone, along a land use gradient to model the association of land use and occurrence of *M. natalensis* and more generally small mammal communities. We aimed to investigate the following questions. First, what is the diversity of rodent communities in varied land use types in Eastern Sierra Leone? Second, how do patterns of land use affect the occupancy of *M. natalensis* and other sympatric rodents? Finally, is there evidence that the local spatial distribution of *M. natalensis* is regulated by biotic interactions with co-occurring species? We expect these analyses to further understanding of rodent community structures that may explain observed patterns of Lassa fever spillover within this context and the wider endemic region.


## Methods


### Rodent sampling


We conducted rodent trapping surveys between October 2020-April 2023 within and around four village study sites (Baiama; latitude = 7.8375, longitude = -11.2683, Lalehun; latitude = 8.1973, longitude = -11.0803, Lambayama; latitude = 7.8505, longitude = -11.1969, and Seilama; latitude = 8.1224, longitude = -11.1936) in the Lassa fever endemic zone of the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-1) A). Surveys were conducted within trapping grids along a land use gradient of anthropogenic disturbance comprising, forest, agriculture (including fallow and currently in-use areas), and villages (within and outside of permanent structures) (see Appendix \@ref(trap-location-images) for images representative of trapping grid locations). Trapping grids were designated during the initial trapping survey session, one grid was deployed in forest land use, three to four grids were deployed in agricultural land with two grids deployed in village land use. For one village study site, Lambayama, there were no local forest areas, so this land use type was omitted (see Appendix \@ref(trap-effort-grid)). Trapping survey sessions within each village occurred four times annually with two trapping surveys in each of the rainy and dry seasons (May to November and December to April, respectively), giving a total of 10 trapping sessions over the study period (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-1) B).


Village study sites and trapping grids within the village study sites were selected to be representative of land use in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone and based on accessibility to the sites during all seasons and acceptability of the study protocol to the village study site communities (Chapter \@ref(methodschapter) and Appendix \@ref(study-protocol)). The trapping protocol was as follows: at each trapping grid 49 Sherman traps (7.62cm x 8.89cm x 22.86cm) (H.B. Sherman Traps, Tallahasee, USA), were placed in a 7 trap by 7 trap grid, traps were placed 10 metres apart in a regular grid conforming to the local landscape (median trapping grid area = 4,813m^2^). For traps placed within permanent structures trap placement varied from this grid structure. Permanent structures were selected semi-randomly at each visit from a grid projected over the village area, with four traps placed within each structure. The location of each individual trap within trapping grids was geolocated for subsequent data processing. Traps were baited with a locally produced mixture of oats, palm oil and dried fish. Each morning the traps were checked and closed for the day prior to re-baiting during the evening. Each trapping survey session consisted of four consecutive trap-nights (TN) at each trapping grid within the village study site.


The location data of individual traps were harmonised to standardised trapping grid cells. First, a convex hull of a trapping grid across all trapping survey sessions was produced. Second, a regular grid was constructed to overlay this area with a grid cell size of 49m^2^, individual traps were allocated to these grid cells if they were contained within its borders. This produced 2,068 unique 49m^2^ trapping grid cells that individual traps were allocated to for all subsequent analysis (see Appendix \@ref(trap-harmonisation) for a schematic of this process). The `sf` package in the R statistical computing language (R version 4.1.2) was used for geospatial manipulation and analysis [@pebesma_simple_2018; @r_core_team_r_2021]. The four consecutive trap-nights obtained from each trap during a single survey are pooled as a single replicate for the subsequent statistical analysis.


All rodent handling was performed by trained researchers, rodents were sedated with halothane and euthanised prior to obtaining morphological measurements and samples of blood and tissue following published protocols [@fichet-calvet_chapter_2014]. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethical Review Board and Animal Welfare Ethical Review Board of the Royal Veterinary College, United Kingdom (URN: 2019 1949-3), and Njala University, Sierra Leone. The rodents' sex was determined based on external and internal genitalia. Images were obtained of rodents dorsal and ventral aspects. Age estimation was performed through description of each individual's reproductive status (identification of perforate or imperforate vagina, scarring from prior embryo development, current pregnancy status or descent of testes and seminal vesicle development) and weighing of dried eye lenses. Carcasses were destroyed through incineration to eliminate the risk of onward pathogen transmission.


### Species classification


Species identification was performed in the field based on external characteristics using a taxonomic key, including external morphological measurements and characteristics, following Kingdon and Happold [@kingdon_mammals_2013] and Monadjem *et al.* [@monadjem_rodents_2015] (Appendix \@ref(taxonomic-key)). Morphological identification alone is unable to distinguish some small-mammal species within the study area at species level. Therefore, molecular identification was performed on whole blood, tissue or dried blood spots. Samples were stored at -20°C until processing, genomic DNA was extracted using QIAGEN DNAeasy kits as per the manufacturers instructions [@qiagen_dneasy_2023]  (Appendix \@ref(study-protocol)). DNA extracts were amplified using platinum *Taq* polymerase (Invitrogen) and cytochrome B primers [@bangura_lassa_2021]. DNA amplification was assessed through gel electrophoreisis with successful amplification products undergoing Sanger sequencing. Attribution of obtained sequences to rodent species was through the BLAST programme comparing NCBI species records for rodent cytochrome B to our sample sequences [@altschul_basic_1990] (Appendix \@ref(study-protocol)).

### Description of rodent detection and species community structure


Adequacy of sampling effort was assessed using species accumulation curves produced for each village study site and each land use type within a village study site, suggesting sufficient effort to detect the expected rodent species within these categories. We constructed detection/non-detection histories for each grid cell and rodent species, assigning "1" when the species was detected and "0" otherwise. We describe species communities at multiple spatial scales. First, all species identified across all village sites and land use types. Second, all species identified within a village study site. Third, all species identified within a single land use type within a single village study site. We report species richness and Shannon diversity at these different spatial scales.


### Estimating the effect of land use on species occurrence and richness

To adjust for differential probabilities of detection that may be driven by environmental conditions and trapping effort during the trapping study and between species, we use a Bayesian spatial latent factor multi-species occupancy model that incorporates residual species correlations, imperfect detection and spatial autocorrelation. Variable selection was informed by a pre-specified conceptual model (Appendix \@ref(conceptual-model)). Models were defined using the `sfMsPGOcc` function in the `spOccupancy` package in the R statistical computing language [@doser_spoccupancy_2022]. This approach defines the true presence or absence ($_{z}$) of a species ($_{i}$), at grid cell ($_{j}$) as arising from a Bernoulli process (Equation \@ref(eq:3-1)). Where ${\psi}_{j}$ is the probability of occurrence of a species at a grid cell. This is modelled using a logit link where $\beta_{i}$ are the species-specific regression coefficients of the site-specific covariates (${\boldsymbol{x}}_{j}^{\top}$) and a latent process $\text{w}^*_{i, j}$. This latent process incorporates residual species correlations through a small number of latent spatial factors and latent variables representing unmeasured grid cell covariates (Equation \@ref(eq:3-2)). Latent spatial factors account for spatial autocorrelation using a Nearest Neighbour Gaussian Process.


\begin{equation}
{z}_{i,j} \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}\left({\psi}_{i,j}\right)
(\#eq:3-1)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\mathrm{logit}\left({\psi}_{i,j}\right)={\boldsymbol{x}}_{j}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\beta_{i}} + \text{w}^*_{i, j}
(\#eq:3-2)
\end{equation}


The species-specific regression coefficients ($\beta_{i}$) are specified as random effects arising from a common community level distribution (Equation \@ref(eq:3-3)). Where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\beta}$ represents the community level mean effect for each occurrence covariate effect and $\boldsymbol{T}_{\beta}$ is a diagonal matrix representing the variability of these among the species in the community.


\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\beta}_i \sim \text{Normal}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\beta}, \boldsymbol{T}_{\beta})
(\#eq:3-3)
\end{equation}


The detection component estimates the unobserved ${z}_{i,j}$. Here, ${y}_{i,j,k}$ is the observed detection or non-detection of a species $i$, at site $j$, during replicate $k$ (Equation \@ref(eq:3-4)). This is approached as arising from a Bernoulli process conditional on the true latent occurrence process ${p}_{i,j,k}$. The probability of a species being detected at a grid cell, during a replicate (given it is present at grid cell $j$), is a function of grid cell and replicate specific covariates ${\boldsymbol{v}}$ and a set of species-specific regression coefficients ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_{i}$ (Equation \@ref(eq:3-5)).


\begin{equation}
{y}_{i,j,k}\sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}\left({p}_{i,j,k}{z}_{i,j}\right)
(\#eq:3-4)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\mathrm{logit}\left({p}_{i,j,k}\right)={\boldsymbol{v}}_{i,j,k}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i}
(\#eq:3-5)
\end{equation}


Similarly to Equation \@ref(eq:3-3), these coefficients are specified as random effects arising from a common community level distribution, where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\alpha}$ represents the community level mean effect for each detection covariate effect and $\boldsymbol{T}_{\alpha}$ is a diagonal matrix representing the variability of these among species in the community (Equation \@ref(eq:3-6)).


\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i \sim \text{Normal}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{T}_{\alpha})
(\#eq:3-6)
\end{equation}


Minimally informative priors were specified for community and species level coefficients (${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$, a normal prior of mean = 0, variance = 2.72) and for community level occurrence and detection variance parameters ($\boldsymbol{T}_{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{T}_{\beta}$, 0.1 for the scale and shape parameters of the inverse Gamma prior).


We included covariates in the model based on a pre-specified conceptual model and after assessing for co-linearity (defined as strong correlation \>0.8) among variables.  Continuous variables were standardised by scaling values between 0-1. The fully specified model is defined in Equation \@ref(eq:3-7) and \@ref(eq:3-8) and using a single latent spatial factor.


\begin{equation}
\text{Probability of occurrence} \sim \text{Land use type} + \text{Village} + \text{scale}(\text{Distance to permanent structure}) + \text{scale}(\text{Elevation})
(\#eq:3-7)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\text{Probability of detection} \sim \text{scale}(\text{Monthly precipitation}) + \text{Moon fraction} + \text{scale}(\text{Number of trap nights})
(\#eq:3-8)
\end{equation}


Model checks, including mixing patterns of the MCMC sampler and posterior predictive checks were performed as an assessment of goodness of fit. Bayesian p-values were produced at the community level and species level with values greater than 0.1 and less than 0.9 suggestive of adequate model fit. The Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) was used to guide final model selection [@watanabe_asymptotic_2010]. Using this model, we estimate occupancy probability for each species in different land use types. Only estimates for species with at least 25 detections are included to avoid inference from limited data.


We drew posterior samples from the most parsimonious Bayesian occupancy model incorporating spatial autocorrelation to estimate the probability of occurrence of a species within a trapping grid cell. 


### Co-occurrence of *Mastomys natalensis* with sympatric species

To investigate the presence of competitive exclusion of the reservoir host of Lassa fever by other rodent species within these communities we examined the correlation of the probability of occupancy of species pairs. The predicted probability of occupancy at each of the grid cells from our spatial multi-species occupancy model was obtained. We stratified these by land use type and calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficient ($\rho$), conducting a two-sided test for statistical significance with a null hypothesis of no correlation between the probability of occupancy for these species. We constrain this analysis to species pairs that were detected in the land use setting in the observed data informing our model to limit inference from sparse data. Further, due to multiple statistical tests we use a conservative value of statistical significance where *p* <= 0.005 represents a statistically significant association to minimise the reporting of false positive associations [@benjamin_redefine_2018]. A statistically significant positive correlation was interpreted as species one being more likely to occur in a grid cell of the specific land use type if species two were present. A statistically significant negative correlation was interpreted as species one being less likely to occur in a grid cell of the specific land use type if species two were present. The causal mechanism and direction behind any observed correlations cannot be inferred from our current analysis.

## Results


### Rodent detection and species community structure


During the study period 684 individuals were detected from 43,266 trap-nights across the four village study sites (1.6% trap-success (TS)). The greatest number of individuals, highest species richness and Shannon diversity values were obtained in the agricultural areas, meanwhile, TS was greatest within village settings (i.e., within and outside of permanent structures) (Table \@ref(tab:table-3-1)). The Seilama study site had the highest overall TS, species' richness and Shannon diversity and unlike the three other study sites had the greatest TS in agricultural areas. Species richness in Seilama was twice that of the peri-urban village study site (Lambayama) and had high Shannon diversity across all land use types. The sole peri-urban village study site (Lambayama) located within the expanding boundaries of Kenema city, had the lowest species' richness and Shannon diversity with the majority of rodents detected within the village area.

The most commonly detected rodent species across all land use types was *M. natalensis* (N = 113, 16.5%), followed by *Praomys rostratus* (N = 102, 14.9%), *M. musculus* (N = 90, 13.2%), *R. rattus* (N = 88, 12.9%) and *Lophuromys sikapusi* (N = 57, 8.3%). The insectivorous shrew species *Crocidura olivieri* was the most commonly detected non-rodent species (N = 105, 15.4%). *Mastomys natalensis* and *R. rattus* were detected at all village study sites, although *M. natalensis* was not detected in areas (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-2)). The invasive rodent species *M. musculus* was only detected in the Lambayama study site. The detection rate (the number of individuals detected per 1,000 TN) varied by species, landuse type and village study site. The greatest rate of detection was for *M. musculus* in the Lambayama village study site, with the other commensal species *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* having high detection rates across multiple village study sites within village land use types. *P. rostratus.* had the highest detection rates in forest and agricultural areas.

(ref:short-12) Detection rate per 1,000 trap nights of rodent species across different land use types.

There was some observed variation in species detection by season. Although, the prevalence of a species (measured as the rate of detections per 1,000 TN), not accounting for incomplete detection, did not show a single trend for all species (Appendix \@ref(detection-species)). *Mus musculus* had a greater detection rate in the rainy season than dry. Conversely, *L. sikapusi*, and *Mus setulosus* had greater detection rates in the dry season. The other species had similar detection rates across both seasons. There was some further variation when stratified by landuse type. *Mastomys natalensis* had greater detection rates in villages compared to agricultural areas in the rainy season while in the dry season it was detected at similar rates in village and agricultural areas. *Praomys rostratus* had greater detection rates in forests during the dry season compared with the rainy season. No other species had important variations by season stratified by land use type.

###  Estimating the effect of land use on species occurrence and richness

We found three patterns of probability of occurrence ($\psi$) within a trapping grid cell for the seven included species (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-3). and, marginal effects of the detection parameters shown in Appendix \@ref(detection-parameters)). First, *M. natalensis*, *R. rattus* and *M. musculus* had greatest probabilities of occurrence in villages with lower occurrence probabilities in agricultural and forest areas. *Mastomys natalensis* differed from the two commensal, invasive species (*R. rattus* and *M. musculus*) as their probability of occurrence in agricultural settings was generally high. Second, *P. rostratus* had high probability of occurrence in forests with lower probabilities in agricultural areas and villages. Finally, *C. olivieri*, *L. sikapusi* and *M. setulosus* had their highest probabilities of occurrence in agricultural areas with lower probabilities of occurrence in forests and villages. No species showed high probability of occurrence across all land use types, consistent with species being adapted to distinct ecological niches.

The probability of occurrence within a trapping grid cell, within the same land use type showed wide variability for some species. For example, the narrow range of probabilities for *M. natalensis* in forests (0-13%) is suggestive that the probability of this species occurring within forests is low. This compares to the wide variability for *P. rostratus* in agricultural areas, here, the probability of occurrence ranged from 0-90% is suggestive that additional environmental factors other than land use type are affecting their occurrence. 


To further explore these factors we stratified village study sites by human population density into rural and peri-urban (rural <= 500 individuals per 1km^2^) (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-3)). The probability of occurrence of *M. natalensis* was importantly different between these settings, with high probability of occurrence in both agricultural and village settings in rural areas but substantially lower probability in peri-urban study sites. The same pattern was observed for *R. rattus*. For the rodent species predicted to have lower probability of occurrence in village settings, namely, *P. rostratus*, *L. sikapusi* and *M. setulosus* probabilities of occurrence were greater in all landuse types in rural areas compared to peri-urban areas. Shrew species were predicted to have similar probabilities of occurrence in rural and peri-urban areas. Human population density itself or other associated environmental factors may therefore be importantly contributing to rodent species occurrence. 


In contrast to species found throughout our study area, *M. musculus* was predicted to have a low probability of occurrence in all landuse types in rural areas, with high values only for village settings in peri-urban areas. The occurrence probabilities for the three commensal species (*M. natalensis*, *R. rattus* and *M. musculus*) suggest that competition may be reducing the occurrence of *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* in the presence of *M. musculus* as in it's absence these two species have high occurrence probabilities in villages.

### Co-occurrence of species within land use types

Our tests for species correlations supported our prior hypothesis that the local spatial distribution of *M. natalensis* is regulated by biotic interactions with co-occurring species (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-4)). We observed that in land use types where both *M. natalensis* and *M. musculus* co-occurred the presence of one species led to a reduction in the probability of occurrence at a grid cell level of the other with a statistically significant negative correlation observed in agricultural (Spearman's $\rho$ = -0.67, *p* < 0.001) and village ($\rho$ = -0.35, *p* < 0.001) settings. This negative relationship was not observed between *M. natalensis* and the other commensal, invasive rodent *R. rattus*, where a positive correlation between probabilities of occurrences in both agricultural ($\rho$ = 0.51, *p* < 0.001) and village  ($\rho$ = 0.36, *p* < 0.001) settings was observed. 

Generally, within villages, high probabilities for the presence of *M. musculus* was associated with lower probabilities for all other rodent species. This was not replicated for *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus*, which were positively associated with the co-occurrence of other native rodent species *P. rostratus*, *L. sikapusi* and *M. setulosus*. Across all landuse types, the presence of the shrew species *C. olivieri* had a negative correlation with the presence of rodent species'.

## Discussion

Our analysis presented the results of a systematic small-mammal trapping study in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone investigating rodent species communities across a land use gradient in a Lassa fever endemic region. First, we found similar species richness and diversity to rodent sampling from other regions of the Lassa fever endemic zone in Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone [@fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_small_2018; @bangura_lassa_2021]. We found that species richness and diversity was highest in agricultural land use settings with reduced richness in both forests and villages. There was important variation of species richness and diversity between different land use types in peri-urban and rural settings. Second, the reservoir host of LASV, *M. natalensis* showed a response to human dominated land use with the highest probability of occupancy in villages, followed by agricultural settings and likely absence from forests. We observed similar patterns of occurrence for the two invasive, commensal, rodent species *M. musculus* and *R. rattus*. Following stratification by human population density, we found that the probability of occurrence of *M. natalensis* was lower in peri-urban settings where *M. musculus* has replaced *M. natalensis* as the dominant commensal rodent species. Finally, we assessed for correlations in the probability of co-occurrence. We found a negative association between the probability of occupancy of *M. natalensis* and *M. musculus* within villages that could have important implications for the understanding of risk of spillover of Lassa fever in endemic regions.

### Rodent communities are associated with land use type

Rodent species richness was found to be greatest in agricultural settings. In these settings both synanthropic and non-synanthropic species were found, resulting in increased species richness and diversity. Agricultural land use may thus provide greater opportunity for LASV transmission among species within diverse rodent communities. 


There is some evidence for a role of the wider rodent community in LASV transmission. Current or prior infection with LASV (through detection of virus or antibodies), has been identified in 11 additional small mammal species, whether these represent incidental infections or competent chains of viral transmission are not known [@monath_lassa_1974; @demby_lassa_2001; @fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_new_2016; @simons_rodent_2023]. It is possible that viral sharing within rodent communities is greatest in these species rich agricultural settings, allowing introduction or re-introduction of the pathogen into isolated commensal species populations following extinction [@bordes_transmission_2015]. This may be particularly important for maintaining viral persistence in spatially isolated *M. natalensis* populations, as rapid depletion of susceptible individuals is expected in isolated well mixed populations [@goyens_density_2013]. The spatial isolation of communities of this species is support by this study and previous studies finding absence within forested regions and limited geographic dispersal [@leirs_spatial_1996; @huber_community_2005; @marien_movement_2018]. The role of the wider rodent community in translocating LASV between *M. natalensis* populations needs further investigation.


We did not observe that *M. natalensis* was more prevalent in village settings during the dry season, as has been reported from elsewhere in Sierra Leone and Guinea [@fichet-calvet_fluctuation_2007; @bangura_lassa_2021]. Our finding of similar or increased prevalence of *M. natalensis* between seasons, not accounting for imperfect detection, were consistent across our village study sites. It is possible that in this region different agricultural processes or food storage practices by village communities results in different rodent behaviour to elsewhere in its range [@kelly_housing_2013; @leach_local_2017]. Alternatively, increased trap-shyness during periods of increased abundance may mask replication of previous findings. Additional rodent community studies, incorporating local human community behaviour and practices, over longer time periods, and across different geographic regions, would be informative to ascertain seasonal habitat preferences of these rodents. It has been suggested that prevalence of *M. natalensis* within households is the proximal driver of the risk of Lassa fever spillover into human populations driven by the potentially increased rate of human-rodent host contact within households [@bonwitt_at_2017; @marien_households_2020]. Therefore, migration from species rich agricultural settings to within households by hosts of LASV may be an important component of Lassa fever outbreaks.

### Evidence for biotic interactions shaping patterns of rodent species diversity

The finding that rodent species displayed a segregation into distinct ecological niches of human dominated (village and agriculture) or non-human dominated (forest) land use types suggests an important role for biotic factors in species occurrence. The high predicted occupancy of both *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* in human dominated landscapes and positive correlation in co-occurrence is consistent with another study conducted elsewhere in Sierra Leone [@bangura_lassa_2021]. This suggests that these two rodent species do not directly compete for resources and that the presence of one species does not preclude the other. This may not be true for interactions between *M. musculus* with both *R. rattus* and *M. natalensis*. The probability of occurrence of *M. musculus* within villages was negatively correlated with the co-occurrence of both *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus*. *Mus musculus* was also absent in village land use types in rural settings where *R. rattus* and *M. natalensis* had high probabilities of occurring. This trend was replicated for *M. musculus* with all other rodent species in village settings. It is not possible to ascertain from the current study whether M. musculus is expanding into rural settings and what effect this may have on rodent communities and LASV transmission. To identify the causal processes of changes in rodent species community structures in response to invasive species' range expansion longer term monitoring of rodent communities would be beneficial, similar to that conducted in Senegal [@dalecky_range_2015].

### Benefits and challenges of systematic rodent community sampling

Systematic investigation of rodent communities requires a greater amount of sampling effort compared to targeted sampling of a rodent species' within selected habitats. In this study we had a low overall trap success rate compared to other studies focused on synanthropic rodent species' [@olayemi_small_2018; @bangura_lassa_2021; @happi_increased_2022]. Our obtained trap success rate of 3.3% within villages is comparable to the 3% obtained from a study conducted in Bo, Sierra Leone, but is substantially lower than the 17% and 14% reported from Nigeria and Guinea respectively [@fichet-calvet_fluctuation_2007; @bangura_lassa_2021; @happi_increased_2022]. Detection rates of *M. natalensis* within its Western radiation of Nigeria, Guinea and Sierra Leone are also lower than that obtained from Tanzania where trap success rates around 24% are reported from agricultural settings [@mulungu_population_2013]. Whether this represents different behaviour within the species based on food availability is not known, although environmental food availability is known to be associated with trap-shyness [@taylor_reactions_1974; @stryjek_unbiased_2019]. Despite the increased trapping effort required to obtain the necessary number detections for statistical inference, adopting this approach will mitigate some of the biases in rodent species and viral detection introduced by targeted sampling. 

Comparison between studies using different sampling techniques and study designs presents several challenges. Previous studies on rodent communities in the Lassa fever endemic region have used trap success rates as an indirect measure of rodent abundance in the absence of capture-mark-recapture studies [@fichet-calvet_diversity_2009; @olayemi_small_2018; @bangura_lassa_2021]. Our analysis, using a model incorporating imperfect detection, suggests estimating abundance from trap success may not be applicable across different land use types and species (Appendix \@ref(detection-parameters)). For example, we found that the probability of detection of *M. musculus* and *R. rattus* were higher than native species given a consistent amount of trapping effort. Detection rate as a measure of relative abundance has been shown to poorly replicate using combined live-trapping and camera-trapping approaches in the USA [@parsons_monitoring_2022]. Drivers of variability in detection may include trap-shyness (i.e., neophobia) of non-synanthropic species, the availability of resources in the local environment and the placement locations of traps, the contribution of these factors on detection require further study in our setting [@stryjek_unbiased_2019]. Improved harmonisation of rodent sampling designs particularly incorporating systematic rodent community sampling will facilitate direct comparison of rodent species communities and pathogen prevalence across the Lassa fever endemic region.

There are several limitations to the current study. Rodent sampling was limited to a relatively short period, less than three years, it is possible that rodent populations in these settings have important multi-year variations in abundance that could not be captured in our model and therefore the probability of occurrence may be under-estimated for species that were at low abundance during our survey period. Sampling over a longer time period would allow any potential temporal changes in probability of occurrence to be better identified. Similarly, land use in Sierra Leone, particularly agricultural land, goes through multi-year cycles of use. It would be informative to study a single location in the typical transition from forested, to agricultural, to long term fallow and to degraded forest land use to better characterise changes in rodent communities within these settings of land management. Unobserved characteristics of our study villages also likely contributed to the composition of rodent communities, suggested by the wide posterior distributions for some rodent species, expanding this study to sample more villages would be beneficial to allow further generalisation of our findings over the wider region.

### Implications for understanding the risk of Lassa fever spillover

The lower levels of occurrence of *M. natalensis* in agricultural and forest land use is consistent with increasing evidence of LASV prevalence heterogeneity across the endemic region [@marien_households_2020]. In some village communities within the endemic region no evidence of current LASV transmission has been observed within the rodent populations, despite prior human cases or serological evidence of outbreaks, suggesting important temporal and spatial variation in pathogen prevalence [@bangura_lassa_2021; @mccormick_prospective_1987; @leski_sequence_2015]. As discussed above it may be that transmission among the rodent community is short lived with rapid local extinction of LASV [@goyens_density_2013]. This phenomena may implicate non-*M. natalensis* species as being important for transferring the pathogen between communities of *M. natalensis* resident in villages separated by forest, leading to pathogen re-introduction. Several species found to occur in forest settings have been found to have antibodies against LASV, namely *Praomys rostratus*, *M. setulosus*, *Malacomys edwardsi* and *L. striatus* [@monath_lassa_1974; @demby_lassa_2001; @fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_new_2016; @simons_rodent_2023]. To understand the temporal and spatial variability in LASV prevalence rodent sampling across the wider land use gradient are required.

Finally, current disease models of Lassa fever risk do not account for the involvement of multiple rodent species or biotic interactions between species [@basinski_bridging_2021; @mylne_mapping_2015; @olugasa_rubber_2014; @redding_environmental-mechanistic_2016; @fichet-calvet_risk_2009; @klitting_predicting_2022]. Our finding of interactions between *M. natalensis* and primarily *M. musculus* may indicate that Lassa fever risk could be reduced in settings where *M. musculus* is present. Further research exploring the competence of *M. musculus* as a host of LASV are required, as evidence of prior infection, through serological assays has been reported [@demby_lassa_2001]. If *M. musculus* is not a competent host of LASV this may go some way to explain why Lassa fever is more typically reported from rural locations in the endemic region rather than cities, where this invasive species may have displaced more competent viral hosts. Further work systematically sampling across the urban-rural gradient will be required to test this hypothesis which will have implications for estimates of future Lassa fever risk. West Africa continues to undergo large population growth and rapid urbanisation, the expansion of *M. musculus* may therefore moderate the risk of increasing numbers of Lassa fever outbreaks.
