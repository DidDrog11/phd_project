# Land use gradients drive spatial variation in Lassa fever host communities in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. {#chapter3}


## Preface {-}


I conceived of the study with Richard Kock, Deborah Watson-Jones and Kate E. Jones. I designed the rodent trapping methodology, study protocol and formulated the data collection tool. I designated the locations of the rodent trapping grids, compiled the taxonomic keys and trained the local fieldwork collaborators on the study processes. The local fieldwork team, including Dianah Sondufu, Joyce Lamin, Michael Dawson, Momoh Jimmy and James Koninga conducted repeat sampling at previously designated locations under my direct and indirect supervision. Umaru Bangura trained me on the molecular identification of rodent and shrew species and provided remote support to this work conducted in Sierra Leone. I trained Joseph Lahai in Sierra Leone on DNA extraction from rodent and shrew samples and he prepared samples for sequencing under my direct and indirect supervision. I performed statistical analysis and interpreted model outputs with support from Rory Gibb. I received support for my work in Sierra Leone from Rashid Ansumana. I wrote this chapter and Rory Gibb, Richard Kock, Deborah Watson-Jones and Kate E. Jones contributed to and approved the final version. 

This chapter in modified format is being prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.


## Abstract  


The natal multimammate mouse (*Mastomys natalensis*) is the reservoir host species of the zoonosis, Lassa fever (*Lassa mammarenavirus*). The spatial occurrence and abundance of this rodent species is regulated by the human environment and biotic interactions within small-mammal communities. However, little is known about these processes even in highly endemic areas of Lassa fever. Here, I conducted a rodent trapping study in a Lassa endemic region within the Eastern Province, Sierra Leone to understand how *M. natalensis* is distributed across a gradient of land use types and how its distribution may be influenced by the small-mammal community structure. I developed a Bayesian multi-species occupancy model using data from a multi-year trapping study (43,226 trap nights, 4 village sites, between 2020-2023) and show that, locally within study sites, *M. natalensis* occupancy increased along a gradient from less to more human dominated habitats (i.e., from forest through agriculture to village). However, within more intense anthropogenic land use (i.e., peri-urban settings) their probability of occupancy reduced below that of agricultural land use types. Competitive interactions with invasive rodent species within the small-mammal community may alter the occupancy of *M. natalensis*, with the presence of *Mus musculus*, but not *Rattus rattus* in peri-urban settings associated with a reduced probability of occupancy of *M. natalensis*. This finding may help to explain past observations of lower-than-expected human cases of Lassa fever from urban settings in endemic regions. These findings highlight that land use drives spatial heterogeneity in rodent reservoir populations via both habitat and small-mammal community dynamics, with implications for the hazard of Lassa fever outbreaks. Therefore, to quantify public health risk and effectively allocate limited healthcare resources more accurate characterisation of small-mammal communities is required in regions at risk of Lassa fever outbreaks.


## Introduction


Global biodiversity is declining, with varied direct effects of biodiversity change on the risk of zoonosis to human populations [@sala_global_2000; @mantyka-pringle_climate_2015; @ipbes_workshop_2020]. Land use change is identified as a key driver in the decline of multiple measures of mammalian species biodiversity including; taxonomic diversity (the number and relative abundance of taxa), functional biodiversity (an increase in the abundance of generalist, synanthropic animals) and interaction diversity (the biotic interactions among species) [@naeem_functions_2012; @glidden_human-mediated_2021]. Specifically, within rodent associated zoonotic disease systems, conversion of natural habitats to agricultural or urban ecosystems preferentially favours, generalist, synanthropic species, which are more likely to be hosts of zoonoses and can increase the prevalence of pathogens within human-dominated environments [@young_declines_2014; @gibb_zoonotic_2020].


The role of species community structure in zoonosis spillover risk is complex. The "dilution effect" posits that increased species taxonomic diversity reduces pathogen prevalence within a system, and through this reducing spillover risk [@keesing_effects_2006]. The "amplification effect" can be considered the inverse where infectious disease transmission is proposed to be increased in species rich systems and therefore spillover risk may be increased [@randolph_pangloss_2012]. Individual zoonotic disease systems may however lie on a spectrum of these effects, as has been suggested by research demonstrating that species richness of zoonotic hosts but not non-hosts increases in anthropogenically dominated habitats [@gibb_zoonotic_2020]. A greater mechanistic understanding of the association of biodiversity, beyond species richness, incorporating community structure, biotic interactions between species and differential responses to anthropogenic land use change is required [@salkeld_meta-analysis_2013; @glidden_human-mediated_2021]. These approaches have only been taken for a few rodent associated zoonoses.


Rodents are identified as an important mammalian host taxa for zoonotic diseases [@han_rodent_2015; @mendoza_does_2019]. Rodent-associated zoonoses, such as Lyme disease caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato*, have been shown to involve a complex interplay of community structure, biotic interactions, and the effect of land use change. Notably, changes in land use have driven a reduction in predation pressure on rodent species, resulting in a surge in the abundance of rodent reservoir species, subsequently increasing pathogen abundance and spillover risk [@ostfeld_are_2004]. The effect of land use change on rodent communities has also been investigated in an East African setting, where conversion to agricultural land was associated with a reduction in small mammal diversity, but no general trend in the prevalence of multiple zoonotic pathogens [@young_interacting_2017]. These examples, along with others, suggest an idiosyncratic response to zoonotic disease risk in response to land use change, where the presence of zoonotic host within a setting does not necessarily directly equate to zoonosis spillover [@mendoza_does_2019]. Lassa fever, caused by *Lassa mammarenavirus* (LASV), is an important rodent-associated zoonosis across West Africa causing substantial morbidity and mortality in human communities. Yet the effects of land use change on rodent communities in these settings have only been explored in a limited geographic area, with most studies focusing on the role of the rodent reservoir [@fichet-calvet_spatial_2005; @fichet-calvet_diversity_2009; @fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_small_2018; @arruda_niche_2021].


Lassa fever is an endemic zoonosis in eight West African countries (Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Benin, Ghana and Togo) [@world_health_organisation_lassa_2022]. The burden of this zoonosis on human communities is unclear with large uncertainties around estimates of the annual number human of infections between 100,000-900,00 [@mccormick_prospective_1987; @basinski_bridging_2021]. Risk of infection in human populations appears spatially heterogeneous with patchy distributions of reported cases within endemic countries [@gibb_understanding_2017; @agbonlahor_52_2021; @grant_seroprevalence_2023]. Drivers of this are not well understood and may in part be epidemiological (e.g., patterns of acquired immunity and asymptomatic infection), but may also be strongly shaped by reservoir host ecology and distribution [@mccormick_prospective_1987]. *Mastomys natalensis*, considered the main reservoir host, is a commensal, synanthropic rodent species found in 13 of 14 continental West African nations and in all other sub-Saharan African countries [@iucn_iucn_2016]. It is abundant in and around areas of human-dominated landscapes where it is considered a pest species [@leirs_productivity_1993]. Population dynamics within this reservoir species are associated with resource availability and rainfall pulses (with increased abundance at the beginning of the dry season) [@leirs_forecasting_1996; @leirs_stochastic_1997]. These environmental factors have also been shown to be closely associated with outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations [@redding_geographical_2021]. However, the most intensive studies of rodent host ecology have been conducted outside of the Lassa fever endemic region, with substantially different agro-ecologies which may limit applicability of findings to West Africa [@leirs_forecasting_1996].


There is therefore a pressing need for systematic small-mammal community studies in West Africa to ensure relevance to Lassa fever, and to disentangle the respective roles of abiotic (e.g., land use type) and biotic (e.g., interactions within the small-mammal community) factors in shaping the local distribution of *M. natalensis* and subsequent patterns of pathogen exposure risk. *Mastomys natalensis* occurs within species rich settings in West Africa, biotic interactions between this species and other native and invasive rodents within communities and how these may alter *M. natalensis* occurrence are not well described [@fichet-calvet_diversity_2009; @garba_spatial_2014; @cuypers_no_2017; @hima_native_2019]. For example, outside of the endemic region the invasion of *R. rattus* and *M. musculus* have been shown to alter rodent communities leading to local exclusion of native rodent species [@dalecky_range_2015; @lippens_genetic_2017]. This may have important implications for pathogen prevalence, and therefore the subsequent risk of disease outbreaks, as competent hosts of LASV are replaced by less competent hosts.


Here, I conducted repeated, systematic, rodent trapping in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone, along a land use gradient to model the association of land use and occurrence of *M. natalensis* and more generally small-mammal communities. Sierra Leone is associated with frequent outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations, with evidence of outbreaks beyond the traditionally accepted endemic region [@grant_seroprevalence_2023]. Studies of rodent ecology within Sierra Leone have generally focused solely on the occurrence of *M. natalensis* through targeted (i.e., in response to a human outbreak of Lassa fever) or opportunistic rodent trapping [@monath_lassa_1974; @keenlyside_case-control_1983; @mccormick_prospective_1987; @bonner_poor_2007]. The structure of rodent communities in this region is not well understood and there is limited evidence of the spatial occurrence of invasive rodent species [@bonwitt_at_2017; @bangura_lassa_2021]. I aimed to investigate the following questions. First, what is the diversity of small-mammal communities in varied land use types in Eastern Sierra Leone? Second, how do patterns of land use affect the occupancy of *M. natalensis* and other sympatric small-mammal species? Finally, is there evidence that the local spatial distribution of *M. natalensis* is regulated by biotic interactions with co-occurring species? I expect these analyses to further understanding of small-mammal community structures that may explain observed patterns of Lassa fever spillover within this context and the wider endemic region.


## Methods


### Small-mammal sampling


I conducted small-mammal trapping surveys between October 2020-April 2023 within and around four village study sites (Baiama; latitude = 7.8375, longitude = -11.2683, Lalehun; latitude = 8.1973, longitude = -11.0803, Lambayama; latitude = 7.8505, longitude = -11.1969, and Seilama; latitude = 8.1224, longitude = -11.1936) in the Lassa fever endemic zone of the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone (Chapter \@ref(methodschapter) and Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-1) A). Surveys were conducted within trapping grids along a land use gradient of anthropogenic disturbance comprising, forest, agriculture (including fallow and currently in-use areas), and villages (within and outside of permanent structures) (see Appendix \@ref(trap-location-images) for images representative of trapping grid locations). Trapping grids were designated during the initial trapping survey session, one grid was deployed in forest land use, three to four grids were deployed in agricultural land with two grids deployed in village land use. For one village study site, Lambayama, there were no local forest areas, so this land use type was omitted (see Appendix \@ref(trap-effort-grid)). Trapping survey sessions within each village occurred four times annually with two trapping surveys in each of the rainy and dry seasons (May to November and December to April, respectively), producing a total of 10 trapping sessions over the study period (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-1) B).


Village study sites and trapping grids within the village study sites were selected to be representative of land use in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone and based on accessibility to the sites during all seasons and acceptability of the study protocol to the village study site communities (Chapter \@ref(methodschapter) and Appendix \@ref(study-protocol)). The trapping protocol was as follows: at each trapping grid 49 Sherman traps (7.62cm x 8.89cm x 22.86cm) (H.B. Sherman Traps, Tallahasee, USA), were placed in a 7 trap by 7 trap grid, traps were placed 7 metres apart in a regular grid conforming to the local landscape (median trapping grid area = 4,813m^2^). For traps placed within permanent structures trap placement varied from this grid structure. Permanent structures were selected semi-randomly at each visit from a grid projected over the village area, with four traps placed within each structure. The location of each individual trap within trapping grids was geolocated for subsequent data processing. Traps were baited with a locally produced mixture of peanuts, palm oil and dried fish. Each morning the traps were checked and closed for the day prior to re-baiting during the evening. Each trapping survey session consisted of four consecutive trap-nights (TN) at each trapping grid within the village study site.


The location data of individual traps were harmonised to standardised trapping grid cells. First, a convex hull of a trapping grid across all trapping survey sessions was produced. Second, a regular grid was constructed to overlay this area with a grid cell size of 49m^2^, individual traps were allocated to these grid cells if they were contained within its borders. This produced 2,068 unique 49m^2^ trapping grid cells that individual traps were allocated to for all subsequent analysis (see Appendix \@ref(trap-harmonisation) for a schematic of this process). The `sf` package in the R statistical computing language (R version 4.1.2) was used for geospatial manipulation and analysis [@pebesma_simple_2018; @r_core_team_r_2021]. The four consecutive trap-nights obtained from each trap during a single survey are pooled as a single replicate for the subsequent statistical analysis.


All small-mammal handling was performed by trained researchers, animals were sedated with halothane and euthanised prior to obtaining morphological measurements and samples of blood and tissue following published protocols [@fichet-calvet_chapter_2014]. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethical Review Board and Animal Welfare Ethical Review Board of the Royal Veterinary College, United Kingdom (URN: 2019 1949-3), and Njala University, Sierra Leone. Sex was determined based on external and internal genitalia. Images were obtained of the animal's dorsal and ventral aspects. Age estimation was performed through description of each individual's reproductive status (identification of perforate or imperforate vagina, scarring from prior embryo development, current pregnancy status or descent of testes and seminal vesicle development) and weighing of dried eye lenses. All carcasses were destroyed through incineration to eliminate the risk of onward pathogen transmission.


### Species classification


Species identification was performed in the field based on external characteristics using a taxonomic key, including external morphological measurements and characteristics, following Kingdon and Happold [@kingdon_mammals_2013] and Monadjem *et al.* [@monadjem_rodents_2015] (Appendix \@ref(taxonomic-key)). Morphological identification alone is unable to distinguish some small-mammal species within the study area at species level. Therefore, molecular identification was performed on whole blood, tissue or dried blood spots. Samples were stored at -20°C until processing, genomic DNA was extracted using QIAGEN DNAeasy kits as per the manufacturers instructions [@qiagen_dneasy_2023]  (Appendix \@ref(study-protocol)). DNA extracts were amplified using platinum *Taq* polymerase (Invitrogen) and cytochrome B primers [@bangura_lassa_2021]. DNA amplification was assessed through gel electrophoreisis with successful amplification products undergoing Sanger sequencing. Attribution of obtained sequences to rodent species was through the BLAST programme comparing NCBI species records for rodent cytochrome B to sample sequences [@altschul_basic_1990] (Appendix \@ref(study-protocol)).

### Description of small-mammal detection and species community structure


Adequacy of sampling effort was assessed using species accumulation curves produced for each village study site and each land use type within a village study site, suggesting sufficient effort to detect the expected rodent species within these categories. I constructed detection/non-detection histories for each grid cell and rodent species, assigning "1" when the species was detected and "0" otherwise. I describe species communities at multiple spatial scales. First, all species identified across all village sites and land use types. Second, all species identified within a village study site. Third, all species identified within a single land use type within a single village study site. I report species richness and Shannon diversity at these different spatial scales [@shannon_mathematical_1948].


### Estimating the effect of land use on species occurrence and richness

To adjust for differential probabilities of detection that may be driven by environmental conditions and trapping effort during the trapping study and between species, I use a Bayesian spatial latent factor multi-species occupancy model that incorporates residual species correlations, imperfect detection and spatial autocorrelation. Variable selection was informed by a pre-specified conceptual model (Appendix \@ref(conceptual-model)). Models were defined using the `sfMsPGOcc` function in the `spOccupancy` package in the R statistical computing language [@doser_spoccupancy_2022]. This approach defines the true presence or absence ($_{z}$) of a species ($_{i}$), at grid cell ($_{j}$) as arising from a Bernoulli process (Equation \@ref(eq:3-1)). Where ${\psi}_{j}$ is the probability of occurrence of a species at a grid cell. This is modelled using a logit link where $\beta_{i}$ are the species-specific regression coefficients of the site-specific covariates (${\boldsymbol{x}}_{j}^{\top}$) and a latent process $\text{w}^*_{i, j}$. This latent process incorporates residual species correlations through a small number of latent spatial factors and latent variables representing unmeasured grid cell covariates (Equation \@ref(eq:3-2)). Latent spatial factors account for spatial autocorrelation using a Nearest Neighbour Gaussian Process.


\begin{equation}
{z}_{i,j} \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}\left({\psi}_{i,j}\right)
(\#eq:3-1)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\mathrm{logit}\left({\psi}_{i,j}\right)={\boldsymbol{x}}_{j}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\beta_{i}} + \text{w}^*_{i, j}
(\#eq:3-2)
\end{equation}


The species-specific regression coefficients ($\beta_{i}$) are specified as random effects arising from a common community level distribution (Equation \@ref(eq:3-3)). Where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\beta}$ represents the community level mean effect for each occurrence covariate effect and $\boldsymbol{T}_{\beta}$ is a diagonal matrix representing the variability of these among the species in the community.


\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\beta}_i \sim \text{Normal}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\beta}, \boldsymbol{T}_{\beta})
(\#eq:3-3)
\end{equation}


The detection component estimates the unobserved ${z}_{i,j}$. Here, ${y}_{i,j,k}$ is the observed detection or non-detection of a species $i$, at site $j$, during replicate $k$ (Equation \@ref(eq:3-4)). This is approached as arising from a Bernoulli process conditional on the true latent occurrence process ${p}_{i,j,k}$. The probability of a species being detected at a grid cell, during a replicate (given it is present at grid cell $j$), is a function of grid cell and replicate specific covariates ${\boldsymbol{v}}$ and a set of species-specific regression coefficients ${\boldsymbol{\alpha}}_{i}$ (Equation \@ref(eq:3-5)).


\begin{equation}
{y}_{i,j,k}\sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}\left({p}_{i,j,k}{z}_{i,j}\right)
(\#eq:3-4)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\mathrm{logit}\left({p}_{i,j,k}\right)={\boldsymbol{v}}_{i,j,k}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i}
(\#eq:3-5)
\end{equation}


Similarly to Equation \@ref(eq:3-3), these coefficients are specified as random effects arising from a common community level distribution, where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\alpha}$ represents the community level mean effect for each detection covariate effect and $\boldsymbol{T}_{\alpha}$ is a diagonal matrix representing the variability of these among species in the community (Equation \@ref(eq:3-6)).


\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i \sim \text{Normal}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{T}_{\alpha})
(\#eq:3-6)
\end{equation}


Minimally informative priors were specified for community and species level coefficients (${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$, a normal prior of mean = 0, variance = 2.72) and for community level occurrence and detection variance parameters ($\boldsymbol{T}_{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{T}_{\beta}$, 0.1 for the scale and shape parameters of the inverse Gamma prior).


I included covariates in the model based on a pre-specified conceptual model and after assessing for co-linearity (defined as strong correlation \>0.8) among variables.  Continuous variables were standardised by scaling values between 0-1. The fully specified model is defined in Equation \@ref(eq:3-7) and \@ref(eq:3-8) and using a single latent spatial factor.


\begin{equation}
\text{Probability of occurrence} \sim \text{Land use type} + \text{Village} + \text{scale}(\text{Distance to permanent structure}) + \text{scale}(\text{Elevation})
(\#eq:3-7)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\text{Probability of detection} \sim \text{scale}(\text{Monthly precipitation}) + \text{Moon fraction} + \text{scale}(\text{Number of trap nights})
(\#eq:3-8)
\end{equation}


Model checks, including mixing patterns of the MCMC sampler and posterior predictive checks were performed as an assessment of goodness of fit. Bayesian p-values were produced at the community level and species level with values greater than 0.1 and less than 0.9 suggestive of adequate model fit. The Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) was used to guide final model selection [@watanabe_asymptotic_2010]. Using this model, I estimate occupancy probability for each species in different land use types. Only estimates for species with at least 25 detections are included to avoid inference from limited data.

I drew posterior samples from the most parsimonious Bayesian occupancy model incorporating spatial autocorrelation to estimate the probability of occurrence of a species within a trapping grid cell. The most parsimonious model included variables for land use type and study village (Equation 9) to model the probability of occurrence. Equation 9 was used for the probability of detection component with a single latent spatial factor used.


### Co-occurrence of *Mastomys natalensis* with sympatric species

To investigate the presence of competitive exclusion of the reservoir host of Lassa fever by other sympatric species within these communities I examined the correlation of the probability of occupancy of species pairs. The predicted probability of occupancy at each of the grid cells from the spatial multi-species occupancy model was obtained. I stratified these by land use type and calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficient ($\rho$), conducting a two-sided test for statistical significance with a null hypothesis of no correlation between the probability of occupancy for these species. I constrain this analysis to species pairs that were detected in the land use setting in the observed data informing the model to limit inference from sparse data. Further, due to multiple statistical tests I use a conservative value of statistical significance where *p* <= 0.005 represents a statistically significant association to minimise the reporting of false positive associations [@benjamin_redefine_2018]. A statistically significant correlation was interpreted as one species being more (if a positive correlation) or less (if a negative correlation) likely to occur in a grid cell of the specific land use type if the other species were present. The causal mechanism and direction behind any observed correlations cannot be inferred from the current analysis.

## Results


### Small-mammal detection and species community structure


During the study period 684 individuals were detected from 43,266 trap-nights across the four village study sites (1.6% trap-success (TS)). The greatest number of individuals, highest species richness and Shannon diversity values were obtained in the agricultural areas, meanwhile, TS was greatest within village settings (i.e., within and outside of permanent structures) (Table \@ref(tab:table-3-1)). The Seilama study site had the highest overall TS, species' richness and Shannon diversity and unlike the three other study sites had the greatest TS in agricultural areas. Species richness in Seilama was twice that of the peri-urban village study site (Lambayama) and had high Shannon diversity across all land use types. The sole peri-urban village study site (Lambayama) located within the expanding boundaries of Kenema city, had the lowest species' richness and Shannon diversity with the majority of individuals detected within the village area.

The most commonly detected rodent species across all land use types was *M. natalensis* (N = 113, 16.5%), followed by *Praomys rostratus* (N = 102, 14.9%), *M. musculus* (N = 90, 13.2%), *R. rattus* (N = 88, 12.9%) and *Lophuromys sikapusi* (N = 57, 8.3%). The insectivorous shrew species *Crocidura olivieri* was the most commonly detected non-rodent species (N = 105, 15.4%). *Mastomys natalensis* and *R. rattus* were detected at all village study sites, although *M. natalensis* was never detected in forest settings (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-2)). The invasive rodent species *M. musculus* was only detected in the Lambayama study site. The detection rate (the number of individuals detected per 1,000 TN) varied by species, land use type and village study site. The greatest rate of detection was for *M. musculus* in the Lambayama village study site, with the other commensal species *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* having high detection rates across multiple village study sites within village land use types. *P. rostratus.* had the highest detection rates in forest and agricultural areas.

(ref:short-12) Detection rate per 1,000 trap nights of rodent species across different land use types.

There was some observed variation in species detection by season. Although, the prevalence of a species (measured as the rate of detections per 1,000 TN), not accounting for incomplete detection, did not show a single trend for all species (Appendix \@ref(detection-species)). *Mus musculus* had a greater detection rate in the rainy season than dry. Conversely, *L. sikapusi*, and *Mus setulosus* had greater detection rates in the dry season. The other species had similar detection rates across both seasons. There was some further variation when stratified by land use type. *Mastomys natalensis* had greater detection rates in villages compared to agricultural areas in the rainy season while in the dry season it was detected at similar rates in village and agricultural areas. *Praomys rostratus* had greater detection rates in forests during the dry season compared with the rainy season. No other species had important variations by season stratified by land use type.

###  Estimating the effect of land use on species occurrence and richness

I found three patterns of probability of occurrence ($\psi$) within a trapping grid cell for the seven included species (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-3). and, marginal effects of the detection parameters shown in Appendix \@ref(detection-parameters)). First, *M. natalensis*, *R. rattus* and *M. musculus* had greatest probabilities of occurrence in villages with lower occurrence probabilities in agricultural and forest areas. *Mastomys natalensis* differed from the two commensal, invasive species (*R. rattus* and *M. musculus*) as their probability of occurrence in agricultural settings was generally high. Second, *P. rostratus* had high probability of occurrence in forests with lower probabilities in agricultural areas and villages. Finally, *C. olivieri*, *L. sikapusi* and *M. setulosus* had their highest probabilities of occurrence in agricultural areas with lower probabilities of occurrence in forests and villages. No species showed high probability of occurrence across all land use types, consistent with species being adapted to distinct ecological niches.

The probability of occurrence within a trapping grid cell, within the same land use type showed wide variability for some species. For example, the narrow range of probabilities for *M. natalensis* in forests (0-13%) is suggestive that the probability of this species occurring within forests is low. This compares to the wide variability for *P. rostratus* in agricultural areas, here, the probability of occurrence ranged from 0-90% is suggestive that additional environmental factors other than land use type are affecting their occurrence. 


To further explore these factors I stratified village study sites by human population density into rural and peri-urban (rural <= 500 individuals per 1km^2^) (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-3)). The probability of occurrence of *M. natalensis* was importantly different between these settings, with high probability of occurrence in both agricultural and village settings in rural areas but substantially lower probability in peri-urban study sites. The same pattern was observed for *R. rattus*. For the rodent species predicted to have lower probability of occurrence in village settings, namely, *P. rostratus*, *L. sikapusi* and *M. setulosus* probabilities of occurrence were greater in all land use types in rural areas compared to peri-urban areas. Shrew species were predicted to have similar probabilities of occurrence in rural and peri-urban areas. Human population density itself or other associated environmental factors may therefore be importantly contributing to rodent species occurrence.


In contrast to species found throughout the study area, *M. musculus* was predicted to have a low probability of occurrence in all land use types in rural areas, with high values only for village settings in peri-urban areas. The occurrence probabilities for the three commensal species (*M. natalensis*, *R. rattus* and *M. musculus*) suggest that competition may be a factor in reducing the occurrence of *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* in the presence of *M. musculus* as in its absence these two species have high occurrence probabilities in villages.

### Co-occurrence of species within land use types

The tests for species correlations show patterns consistent with the prior hypothesis that the local spatial distribution of *M. natalensis* is regulated by biotic interactions with co-occurring species (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-3-4)). However, this analytical approach is unable to demonstrate a causal mechanism between co-occurrence and the probability of occurrence, it is possible that unmeasured factors may be responsible for the apparent association. I observed that in land use types where both *M. natalensis* and *M. musculus* co-occurred the presence of one species was associated with a reduction in the probability of occurrence at a grid cell level of the other with a statistically significant negative correlation observed in agricultural (Spearman's $\rho$ = -0.67, *p* < 0.001) and village ($\rho$ = -0.35, *p* < 0.001) settings. This negative relationship was not observed between *M. natalensis* and the other commensal, invasive rodent *R. rattus*, where a positive correlation between probabilities of occurrences in both agricultural ($\rho$ = 0.51, *p* < 0.001) and village  ($\rho$ = 0.36, *p* < 0.001) settings was observed. 

Generally, within villages, high probabilities for the presence of *M. musculus* were associated with lower probabilities for all other rodent species. This was not replicated for *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus*, which were positively associated with the co-occurrence of other native rodent species *P. rostratus*, *L. sikapusi* and *M. setulosus*. Across all land use types, the presence of the shrew species *C. olivieri* had a negative correlation with the presence of rodent species.

## Discussion


This analysis presented the results of a systematic small-mammal trapping study in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone investigating rodent species communities across a land use gradient in a Lassa fever endemic region. First, I found similar species richness and diversity to small-mammal sampling from other regions of the Lassa fever endemic zone in Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone [@fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_small_2018; @bangura_lassa_2021]. I found that species richness and diversity was highest in agricultural land use settings with reduced richness in both forests and villages. There was important variation of species richness and diversity between different land use types in peri-urban and rural settings. Second, the reservoir host of LASV, *M. natalensis* showed a response to human dominated land use with the highest probability of occupancy in villages, followed by agricultural settings and likely absence from forests. I observed similar patterns of occurrence for the two invasive, commensal, rodent species *M. musculus* and *R. rattus*. Following stratification by human population density, I found that the probability of occurrence of *M. natalensis* was lower in peri-urban settings where *M. musculus* has replaced *M. natalensis* as the dominant commensal rodent species. Finally, I assessed for correlations in the probability of co-occurrence. I found a negative association between the probability of occupancy of *M. natalensis* and *M. musculus* within villages that could have important implications for the understanding of risk of spillover of Lassa fever in endemic regions.


### Small-mammal communities are associated with land use type


Rodent species richness was found to be greatest in agricultural settings. In these settings both synanthropic and non-synanthropic species were found, resulting in increased species richness and diversity. Agricultural land use may thus provide greater opportunity for LASV transmission among species within diverse small-mammal communities. 


There is some evidence for a role of the wider species community in LASV transmission. Current or prior infection with LASV (through detection of virus or antibodies), has been identified in 11 additional small mammal species, whether these represent incidental infections or competent chains of viral transmission are not known [@monath_lassa_1974; @demby_lassa_2001; @fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_new_2016; @simons_rodent_2023]. It is possible that viral sharing within rodent communities is greatest in these species rich agricultural settings, allowing introduction or re-introduction of the pathogen into isolated commensal species populations following extinction [@bordes_transmission_2015]. This may be particularly important for maintaining viral persistence in spatially isolated *M. natalensis* populations, as rapid depletion of susceptible individuals is expected in isolated well mixed populations [@goyens_density_2013]. The spatial isolation of communities of this species is supported by this study and previous studies finding an absence of *M. natalensis* within forested regions and limited geographic dispersal [@leirs_spatial_1996; @huber_community_2005; @marien_movement_2018]. The role of the wider small-mammal community in translocating LASV between *M. natalensis* populations needs further investigation.


*Mastomys natalensis* was not more prevalent in village settings during the dry season, as has been reported from elsewhere in Sierra Leone and Guinea [@fichet-calvet_fluctuation_2007; @bangura_lassa_2021]. The finding of similar or increased prevalence of *M. natalensis* between seasons, not accounting for imperfect detection, were consistent across village study sites. It is possible that in this region different agricultural processes or food storage practices by village communities results in different rodent behaviour to elsewhere in its range [@kelly_housing_2013; @leach_local_2017]. Alternatively, increased trap-shyness during periods of increased abundance may mask replication of previous findings. Additional rodent community studies, incorporating local human community behaviour and practices, over longer time periods, and across different geographic regions, would be informative to ascertain seasonal habitat preferences of these rodents. It has been suggested that prevalence of *M. natalensis* within households is the proximal driver of the risk of Lassa fever spillover into human populations driven by the potentially increased rate of human-rodent host contact within households [@bonwitt_at_2017; @marien_households_2020]. Therefore, migration from species rich agricultural settings to within households of infectious hosts of LASV may be an important component of Lassa fever outbreaks.


### Evidence for biotic interactions shaping patterns of small-mammal species diversity


The finding that small-mammal species displayed segregation into distinct ecological niches of human dominated (village and agriculture) or non-human dominated (forest) landuse types suggests an important role for biotic factors in species occurrence. The high predicted occupancy of both *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus* in human dominated landscapes and positive correlation in co-occurrence is consistent with another study conducted elsewhere in Sierra Leone [@bangura_lassa_2021]. This suggests that these two rodent species may not directly compete for resources and that the presence of one species does not preclude the other. This may not be true for interactions between *M. musculus* with both *R. rattus* and *M. natalensis*. The probability of occurrence of *M. musculus* within villages was negatively correlated with the co-occurrence of both *M. natalensis* and *R. rattus*. *Mus musculus* was also absent in village land use types in rural settings where *R. rattus* and *M. natalensis* had high probabilities of occurring. This trend was replicated for *M. musculus* with all other rodent species in village settings. It is not possible to ascertain from the current study whether *M. musculus* is expanding into rural settings and what effect this may have on rodent communities and LASV transmission. To identify the causal processes of changes in rodent species community structures in response to invasive species' range expansion longer term monitoring of rodent communities would be beneficial, similar to that conducted in Senegal [@dalecky_range_2015].


It is possible that the observed correlations in the probability of species co-occurrence are not driven solely by biotic interactions and that gradients of not included abiotic factors may be associated with changes in small-mammal co-occurrence. For example, if elevation is important to the occurrence of *M. natalensis* but not *M. musculus* and this was systematically different between landuse types this could potentially produce the observed effect of negative associations of co-occurrence between these species.


To identify a causal interaction between *M. natalensis* and *M. musculus* occupancy and any biotic interactions between these species that may moderate their occupancy, investigations at the invasion front of *M. musculus* in Sierra Leonean settings would be informative. Possible ecological mechanisms for these processes, beyond anthropogenic factors such as landuse change, urbanisation and environmental modifications, could include resource competition, competition for breeding habitats, interference competition (i.e., disruption of reproductive behaviours) or territoriality [@harrington_impact_2009; @polito_population_2022; @granjon_sharing_2023]. 


### Benefits and challenges of systematic small-mammal community sampling


Systematic investigation of small-mammal communities requires a greater amount of sampling effort compared to targeted sampling of a single species within selected habitats. In this study I had a low overall trap success rate compared to other studies focused on synanthropic rodent species' [@olayemi_small_2018; @bangura_lassa_2021; @happi_increased_2022]. The obtained trap success rate of 3.3% within villages is comparable to the 3% obtained from a study conducted in Bo, Sierra Leone, but is substantially lower than the 17% and 14% reported from Nigeria and Guinea respectively [@fichet-calvet_fluctuation_2007; @happi_increased_2022]. Detection rates of *M. natalensis* within its Western radiation of Nigeria, Guinea and Sierra Leone are also lower than that obtained from Tanzania where trap success rates around 24% are reported from agricultural settings [@mulungu_population_2013]. Whether this represents different behaviour within the species based on food availability is not known, although environmental food availability is known to be associated with trap-shyness [@taylor_reactions_1974; @stryjek_unbiased_2019]. Despite the increased trapping effort required to obtain the necessary number of detections for statistical inference, adopting this approach will mitigate some of the biases in rodent species and viral detection introduced by targeted sampling. 


Comparison between studies using different sampling techniques and study designs presents several challenges. Previous studies on rodent communities in the Lassa fever endemic region have used trap success rates as an indirect measure of rodent abundance in the absence of capture-mark-recapture studies [@fichet-calvet_diversity_2009; @olayemi_small_2018; @bangura_lassa_2021]. This analysis, using a model incorporating imperfect detection, suggests estimating abundance from trap success may not be applicable across different land use types and species (Appendix \@ref(detection-parameters)). For example, I found that the probability of detection of *M. musculus* and *R. rattus* were higher than native species given a consistent amount of trapping effort. Detection rate as a measure of relative abundance has been shown to poorly replicate using combined live-trapping and camera-trapping approaches in the USA [@parsons_monitoring_2022]. Drivers of variability in detection may include trap-shyness (i.e., neophobia) of non-synanthropic species, the availability of resources in the local environment and the placement locations of traps, the contribution of these factors on detection require further study in this geographic setting [@stryjek_unbiased_2019]. Improved harmonisation of rodent sampling designs particularly incorporating systematic rodent community sampling will facilitate direct comparison of rodent species communities and pathogen prevalence across the Lassa fever endemic region.


There are several limitations to the current study. Animal sampling was limited to a relatively short period, less than three years, it is possible that populations in these settings have important multi-year variations in abundance that could not be captured in the current model and therefore the probability of occurrence may be under-estimated for species that were at low abundance during the survey period. Sampling over a longer time period would allow any potential temporal changes in probability of occurrence to be better identified. Similarly, land use in Sierra Leone, particularly agricultural land, goes through multi-year cycles of use. It would be informative to study a single location in the typical transition from forested, to agricultural, to long term fallow and to degraded forest land use to better characterise changes in rodent communities within these settings of land management. Unobserved characteristics of study villages also likely contributed to the composition of rodent communities, suggested by the wide posterior distributions for some rodent species, expanding this study to sample more villages would be beneficial to allow further generalisation of the current findings over the wider region.


The Bayesian approach used to model species occupancy allowed for the propagation of uncertainty throughout the analysis, however, limitations due to small sample sizes remain. First, small sample sizes in some landuse types and for some species likely increase the uncertainty in modelled parameter estimates, impact the precision of the model. Model checks, including Bayesian p-values at the community (0.5) and individual species (0.16-0.86) level suggested adequate model fit and sample sizes but it would be informative to validate these results on studies conducted elsewhere in Sierra Leone or the same sites over a longer time period. Posterior predictive checks were used for further model validation. Results from this suggest a greater discrepancy in the fit statistic for *C. olivieri*, *M. musculus* and *R. rattus* than the four other species (Appendix \@ref(ppc)). It is likely that the differences in sample sizes, from a more limited number of landuse types and sampling sites led to a greater impact on model accuracy for these species than others. Finally, the threshold of 25 detections used for including a species in the model may influence inference drawn from a model which does not include present, but relatively rare species. However, an observation of improved Bayesian p-values for species with more than 40 detections supports the approach of not including rarely detected species.


### Implications for understanding the risk of Lassa fever spillover


The lower levels of occurrence of *M. natalensis* in agricultural and forest land use is consistent with increasing evidence of LASV prevalence heterogeneity across the endemic region [@marien_households_2020]. In some village communities within the endemic region no evidence of current LASV transmission has been observed within the rodent populations, despite prior human cases or serological evidence of outbreaks, suggesting important temporal and spatial variation in pathogen prevalence [@bangura_lassa_2021; @mccormick_prospective_1987; @leski_sequence_2015]. As discussed above it may be that transmission among the rodent community is short lived with rapid local extinction of LASV [@goyens_density_2013]. This phenomena may implicate non-*M. natalensis* species as being important for transferring the pathogen between communities of *M. natalensis* resident in villages separated by forest, leading to pathogen re-introduction [@guzzetta_population_2017]. Several species found to occur in forest settings have been found to have antibodies against LASV, namely *Praomys rostratus*, *M. setulosus*, *Malacomys edwardsi* and *L. striatus* [@monath_lassa_1974; @demby_lassa_2001; @fichet-calvet_lassa_2014; @olayemi_new_2016; @simons_rodent_2023]. To understand the temporal and spatial variability in LASV prevalence rodent sampling across the wider land use gradient are required.


Finally, current disease models of Lassa fever risk do not account for the involvement of multiple rodent species or biotic interactions between species [@basinski_bridging_2021; @mylne_mapping_2015; @olugasa_rubber_2014; @redding_environmental-mechanistic_2016; @fichet-calvet_risk_2009; @klitting_predicting_2022]. The observation of a negative association in occurrence between *M. natalensis* and *M. musculus* may indicate that Lassa fever risk could be reduced in settings where *M. musculus* is present. Further research exploring the competence of *M. musculus* as a host of LASV are required, as evidence of prior infection, through serological assays has been reported [@demby_lassa_2001]. If *M. musculus* is not a competent host of LASV this may go some way to explain why Lassa fever is more typically reported from rural locations in the endemic region rather than cities, where this invasive species may have displaced more competent viral hosts. Further work systematically sampling across the urban-rural gradient will be required to test this hypothesis which will have implications for estimates of future Lassa fever risk. West Africa continues to undergo large population growth and rapid urbanisation, the expansion of *M. musculus* may therefore moderate the risk of increasing numbers of Lassa fever outbreaks.
