**Understanding rodent host ecology can inform predictions of zoonotic infectious disease spillover events and outbreaks of infections in humans. To do this we need to understand the biases in currently available data and utilise robust survey designs to characterise rodent species assemblages in heterogeneous landscapes. I will show that the composition of rodent species communities varies across a land use gradient and that this may have implications for spillover from rodent host species. Contacts between individuals of zoonotic host and non-host species form dynamic transmission networks for these pathogens that will modulate the risk of pathogen spillover into human populations. Finally, incorporating both host occurrence and co-occurrence with other rodent species can provide additional information that can guide public health interventions to reduce the impact of zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks.**


Endemic zoonotic infectious diseases represent a large proportion of preventable morbidity and mortality across much of the world. The potential for endemic zoonotic infectious diseases to undergo range expansion, increasing the number of individuals at risk of infection is of significant concern. \par

Spillover events of zoonoses into human populations typically occur at a local scale. Sustained human-to-human transmission following spillover can result in epidemics and pandemics of diseases originating from animal reservoirs. \par

Understanding the locations at greatest risk of spillover events is of particular interest to strengthen local public health responses in endemic regions to outbreaks. Additionally, identifying potential locations of spillover of zoonoses is imperative for efforts to prevent pandemics of pathogens of zoonotic origin. \par

Studies assessing locations at greatest risk typically rely upon large consolidated databases of host presence and absence data alongside datasets on host-pathogen associations. Here, I have shown that these datasets suffer from spatial and temporal sampling biases. I produce a synthesised dataset of rodent trapping studies to mitigate some of these biases by providing high-resolution rodent detection and non-detection data alongside spatio-temporal host-pathogen associations.  \par

Understanding the interplay between different rodent species in a host-pathogen system is important to understand the hazard of zoonotic spillover events. Here, I have reported on a rodent sampling study in a Lassa Fever endemic region to describe the association of species detection and land use type accounting for imperfect detection. \par

Within these different land use types species contact each other at different rates. This has implications for the transmission of pathogens within these settings. Here, I have described the contact patterns between individuals of different species and the prevalence of antibodies to our target pathogen to model potential transmission networks. \par
