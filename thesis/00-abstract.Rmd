Within West Africa endemic human infectious diseases with an animal origin (zoonoses) cause potentially preventable morbidity and mortality, the burden of which is expected to increase under future land use, climate and biodiversity change. Rodents are important hosts of both vectors (e.g., ticks) of zoonotic pathogens and of specific rodent associated zoonoses, and an understanding of local scale rodent ecology is vital to quantify the risk of rodent associated zoonotic disease spillover into human populations. This thesis will investigate the effect of rodent community diversity and structure on the risk of zoonosis in Sierra Leone. In this thesis I synthesise the available rodent trapping literature to summarise small-mammal distributions, with a particular focus on rodents, across West Africa and the extent of sampling biases of species', their pathogens and host-pathogen associations. I find that current sampling efforts are spatially and taxonomically biased, limiting generalisability and inference able to be drawn from currently available data. I identify regions of West Africa that have been undersampled and challenges in data synthesis produced by incomplete metadata, suggesting where future effort should be directed to counteract some of these identified biases. This review guided the design and implementation of a three-year, systematic study of rodent ecology in a Lassa fever (*Lassa mammarenavirus*) endemic region of Eastern Sierra Leone to investigate the association of land use type on rodent occurrence. I model the composition of rodent communities at fine spatial scale to infer the changing hazard of Lassa fever spillover across anthropogenic land use gradients. I find that the known reservoir species (*Mastomys natalensis*) of the Lassa fever virus is more likely to occur in locations of anthropogenic land use conversion. I identify important co-occurrence interactions between *Matomys natalensis* and *Mus musculus* that are associated with reduced occurrence of *Mastomys natalensis* in urbanised settings, which may abate the risk of pathogen spillover in these settings. Finally, I reconstruct rodent direct and indirect contact networks to investigate the transmission networks of Lassa fever virus among *Mastomys natalensis* and other small-mammal species previously found to be infected with the virus across an anthropogenic land use gradient. I find that *Mastomys natalensis* have greater rates of contact events in species rich agricultural land use settings compared to within villages. This suggests that contacts between susceptible and infectious rodents in agricultural settings may be maintaining viral prevalence which can then enter village dwelling rodent communities increasing the risk of spillover into human communities. This thesis improves current understanding of the association of land use change on the distribution of *Mastomys natalensis* and the wider small-mammal community in Eastern Sierra Leone and the subsequent spillover risk of *Lassa mammarenavirus*. I find that the hazard of zoonotic spillover is governed by biotic processes, including species co-occurrence and land use conversion, at a local level and identify future research directions to translate knowledge about these dynamic rodent communities into contextually relevant public health interventions using a One Health framework.
