Within West Africa endemic zoonotic infectious diseases cause preventable morbidity and mortality, the burden of which is expected to increase under future land use, climate and biodiversity change. Rodents are important hosts of both vectors of zoonotic pathogens and of specific rodent associated zoonoses, an understanding of local scale rodent ecology is vital to quantify the risk of rodent associated zoonotic disease spillover into human populations. 

In this thesis I synthesise the available rodent trapping literature to summarise rodent distributions across West Africa and the extent of sampling biases of rodent hosts, their pathogens and host-pathogen associations. I find that current sampling efforts are spatially and taxonomically biased, limiting generalisability and inference able to be drawn from currently available data. I suggest approaches that are required to counteract some of these identified biases.

This review guided the design and implementation of a three-year, systematic study of rodent ecology in a Lassa fever endemic region of Eastern Sierra Leone to investigate the association of land use type on rodent occurrence. I model the composition of rodent communities at fine spatial scale to infer the changing hazard of Lassa fever spillover across anthropogenic land use gradients. I find that the known reservoir species of the Lassa fever virus is more likely to occur in locations of anthropogenic land use conversion. I identify important biotic interactions between the primary reservoir of Lassa fever and other rodent species that lead to reduced occurrence in urbanised settings, which may abate the risk of pathogen spillover in these settings. 

Finally, I reconstruct rodent direct and indirect contact networks to investigate the transmission networks of Lassa fever virus among rodent hosts across an anthropogenic land use gradient. I find that hosts of Lassa fever virus have greater rates of contact events in species rich agricultural land use settings compared to within villages. This suggests that contacts between susceptible and infectious rodents in agricultural settings may be maintaining viral prevalence which can then enter village dwelling rodent communities increasing the risk of pathogen spillover into human communities. 

This thesis improves current understanding of the distribution of rodent hosts and endemic zoonotic pathogens across West Africa with a focus on the local rodent ecology in maintaining Lassa fever endemism in Sierra Leone. I find that the hazard of zoonotic spillover is governed by biotic processes at a local level and identify future directions to translate knowledge about these dynamic rodent communities into contextually relevant public health interventions using a One Health framework.
