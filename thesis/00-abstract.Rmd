Endemic zoonotic infectious diseases represent a large proportion of preventable morbidity and mortality across much of the world. The potential for endemic zoonotic infectious diseases to undergo range expansion, increasing the number of individuals at risk of infection is of significant concern. \par

Spillover events of zoonoses into human populations typically occur at a local scale. Sustained human-to-human transmission following spillover can result in epidemics and pandemics of diseases originating from animal reservoirs. \par

Understanding the locations at greatest risk of spillover events is of particular interest to strengthen local public health responses in endemic regions to outbreaks. Additionally, identifying potential locations of spillover of zoonoses is imperative for efforts to prevent pandemics of pathogens of zoonotic origin. \par

Studies assessing locations at greatest risk typically rely upon large consolidated databases of host presence and absence data alongside datasets on host-pathogen associations. Here, I have shown that these datasets suffer from spatial and temporal sampling biases. I produce a synthesised dataset of rodent trapping studies to mitigate some of these biases by providing high-resolution rodent detection and non-detection data alongside spatio-temporal host-pathogen associations.  \par

Understanding the interplay between different rodent species in a host-pathogen system is important to understand the hazard of zoonotic spillover events. Here, I have reported on a rodent sampling study in a Lassa Fever endemic region to describe the association of species detection and land use type accounting for imperfect detection. \par

Within these different land use types species contact each other at different rates. This has implications for the transmission of pathogens within these settings. Here, I have described the contact patterns between individuals of different species and the prevalence of antibodies to our target pathogen to model potential transmission networks. \par

Finally I use the data produced in Chapters 3 and 4 to model the hazard of zoonotic spillover in Eastern Sierra Leone. I adopt a BART to produce a multi-species distribution model to predict the occupancy of different species across the region and information on antibody prevalence to model the occurrence of the pathogen of interest. \par
