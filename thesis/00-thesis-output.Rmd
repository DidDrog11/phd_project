**Invited talks and presentations**

The methodology used and interim results generated from chapter \@ref(chapter2) has been presented at the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Conference 2021.

The methodology used and interim results produced from chapter \@ref(chapter3) has been presented at the Planetary Health Alliance conference 2022, the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Conference 2022 and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases Grand Round.

The methodology used and results of chapter \@ref(chapter4) has been presented at the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Conference 2023, the Rodent-borne zoonoses workshop hosted by the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Pennsylvania State University (2023) and the Development of transmissible vaccines workshop hosted by the University of Idaho.

A summary of the work contained in this thesis will also be presented at the Ecology Society of America annual meeting (2023) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene annual meeting (2023).
