# Rodent trapping studies as an overlooked information source for understanding endemic and novel zoonotic spillover {#chapter2}

## Preamble

## Abstract

## Introduction

## Methods

### Data sources

### Host and pathogen trapping data

## Analysis

### What is the extent of spatial bias in the rodent trapping data?

### Are rodent trapping derived host-pathogen associations present in a consolidated zoonoses dataset?

## Results

### What is the extent of spatial bias in the rodent trapping data?

### Are rodent trapping derived host-pathogen associations present in a consolidated zoonoses dataset?

### What is the spatial extent of pathogen testing within a hostâ€™s range?

## Discussion
