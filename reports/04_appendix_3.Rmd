# Appendix 3: Visit reports: Visit 1 to 3

Five villages have been enrolled, one will not be carried forward due to concerns from the local team. The village are:

  + Lalehun (coordinates  8.1975 N, -11.0803 E) 
    + Visit 1 - 2020-11-30 to 2020-12-03
    + Visit 2 - 2021-04-01 to 2021-04-04
    + Visit 3 - 2021-07-08 to 2021-07-12
    + Visit 4 - 2021-10

Rodents are trapped at up to 6 distinct trap sites per village with up to 49 traps per site. Data is collected on this group of [data collection forms](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yE_JAThq-DM9y5yvtSPMgM2ezMcZ_zyO?usp=sharing) or on the digitised versions using electronic pads in the field using [ODK](https://opendatakit.lshtm.ac.uk/lshtm-odk-servers/) all digital forms are encrypted locally on the device and sent to a server based at LSHTM. The `.xlsx` versions of the ODK forms are available on the OpenScience Framework [project page](https://osf.io/usjrd/).

We have currently obtained 7,270 trap nights across 3 visits (including the pilot). There will ideally be study visits 4 times per year (every 3 months), dates will be confirmed with the study team.

The land use predominantly obtained from Jung et al. and ground truthed through discussion with local communities guided the selection of the trapping sites at study villages.

The locations of traps within these areas are shown with the white points.

The proportion of nights trapping in each habitat gave good coverage when compared to the different land use classes identified in Eastern Sierra Leone.

The trap success rate is around 4% this is fairly acceptable based on the review I did. We have trapped 137 rodents from at least 13 species. The majority of trapped individuals have been shrews (crocidura), *Mastomys sp.*, *Praomys sp.*, *Mus minutoides* and *Lophuromys sp.*. Data from the most recent trapping activities from visit 3 during the rainy season have so far shown a dramatic drop in trap success.

Species accumulation curves have been produced for the first two visits from Lalehun and Seilama. It has not been possible to produce equivalent plots for Baiama and Lambayama due to the low number of individuals/species trapped in those locations.

As we catch an increasing number of individuals we are seeing them clustering within expected habitats.
